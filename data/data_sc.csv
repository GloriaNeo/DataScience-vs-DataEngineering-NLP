"R programmers, what are the greatest issues you have with Python?",15g96dc,joaoareias,1690983500.0,,False,True,Education,262,False,169,"I'm a Data Scientist with a computer science background. When learning programming and data science I learned first through Python, picking up R only after getting a job. After getting hired I discovered many of my colleagues, especially the ones with a statistics or economics background, learned programming and data science through R.

Whether we use Python or R depends a lot on the project but lately, we've been using much more Python than R. My colleagues feel sometimes that their job is affected by this, but they tell me that they have issues learning Python, as many of the tutorials start by assuming you are a complete beginner so the content is too basic making them bored and unmotivated, but if they skip the first few classes, you also miss out on important snippets of information and have issues with the following classes later on.

Inspired by that I decided to prepare a Python course that:

1. Assumes you already know how to program
2. Assumes you already know data science
3. Shows you how to replicate your existing workflows in Python
4. Addresses the main pain points someone migrating from R to Python feels

The problem is, I'm mainly a Python programmer and have not faced those issues myself, so I wanted to hear from you, have you been in this situation? If you migrated from R to Python, or at least tried some Python, what issues did you have? What did you miss that R offered? If you have not tried Python, what made you choose R over Python?",False,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15g96dc/r_programmers_what_are_the_greatest_issues_you/,datascience

How I quickly rose to senior data scientist and eventually senior data engineer.,15fqkuj,on_the_mark_data,1690928046.0,,False,True,Discussion,89,False,208,"TL;DR You need to drive outsized value beyond just your team. That means you need to interact with business stakeholders and consistently solve their business problems with data. The quicker you learn to effectively engage business stakeholders, the quicker you will promote.

If you only ""speak data"" to your stakeholders, you are setting yourself up for failure. You can escape this trap by learning to instead ""translate data"" to your stakeholders. Here's how:

The below means NOTHING to your business stakeholders and you won't get the buy-in you need to actually drive change and value in your respective organization.

""We should care about data quality!""

""We really need to consider creating a proper data model!""

""This data pipeline is a bottleneck for your dashboard!""

Instead...

1. Understand that data is extremely abstract, and most people are not trained to deal with this abstraction. For example, tell me about a single row in an excel sheet? Very easy to name off the fields. Now tell me about a thousand rows in an excel sheet... it's hard. This is exactly what your stakeholders are facing. This is why it's so hard for them to create meaningful requests and requirements.

2. Ask your stakeholders about the business context, the reason why the request is being made, and how the output will be used by the business. Ask probing questions about the business and not the data.

3. Use your domain expertise to map the business requirements to data requirements-- this is now your ""translation"" map for all future communications.

4. With this mapping you need to answer the following without ""speaking data"" to your stakeholder: a) what was the business challenge, b) what is the solution to this business problem, and c) how they can use this solution today. This stakeholder is going to pass this information on to others, so train them to be successful in that. When you help others win, you win as well!

The above sentence examples may look like the following:

""We are fined $X amount by regulators for every wrong record, with our current data we are expected to be fined $Y amount. We can avoid this enormous penalty by implementing Z process."" [Data Quality]

""The most recent board meeting had conflicting financial numbers presented in the deck. Both numbers were 'correct' depending on the tables used and which team was asked. We can prevent this from happening again by cleaning up the which tables can be pulled from and how the numbers are generated."" [Data Model]

""This dashboard has a two day lag, making daily check-ins with enterprise customers difficult. We can change the data pipeline SLA to one day and work towards meeting that SLA given the new business context."" [Slow Data]

RANT - There's a cheating problem in Data Science Interviews,15flo97,forbiscuit,1690916881.0,,False,True,Discussion,160,False,285,"I work at a large company, and we receive quite a lot of applicants. Most of our applicants have 6-9 years of experience in roles titled as Data Analytics/Data Science/Data Engineering across notable companies and brands like Walmart, Ford, Accenture, Amazon, Ulta, Macy's, Nike, etc.

The nature of our interviews is fairly simple - we have a brief phone call on theory and foundation of data analytics, and then have a couple of technical interviews focusing on programming and basic data analysis. The interview doesn't cover anything out of the ordinary for most analysts (not even data scientists), and focuses on basic data analysis practices (filter down a column given a set of requirements, get a count of uniques, do basic EDA and explain how to manage outliers). 

All interviewees are told they can use Google as we don't expect people to memorize the syntax, but we do expect them to have at least working knowledge of the tools we expect them to use. The interviews are all remote and don't require in-person meeting. The interviews are basically screen share of Google Colab where we run basic analysis.

In our recent hiring spree, out of the 7 potential candidates we interviewed, we caught 4 of them cheating.

Given their profile, I'm a bit amazed that they resorted to cheating. Whether it was by having someone else on the call helping them answer the question, or having someone entirely different answer their questions, and other notable methods that I don't want to share that we caught while they were sharing their screens. I've learned from my colleagues that there are actual *agencies* in India and China who offer interview 'assistance' services.

At this stage, our leadership is planning to require all potential candidates to be local - this eliminates remote option. On the same token, those cheaters passing the recruiter screening are quite frankly just making it worse for people who are actually capable. Questions become more theoretical and quite specific to industry, scope of hiring will be limited to people within specific domains, and improptu coding tests will be given out without heads up to hinder people from cheating and setting up whatever they do to cheat.

Disaster job or imposter syndrome?,15gabl3,mancityfan97,1690986354.0,,False,True,Career,15,False,8,"Hi all,

For context, I’ve been a DS for 2+ years and have an MSc in DS. My first role was with a company that was really behind the curve when it came to DS, models were built and run in notebooks, no level of production. I’d say it was half way between an analyst/DS role. I would spend a lot of time building models, but they often wouldn’t go anywhere or do anything (the CEO loved the idea of DS but clearly didn’t want to commit to supporting the team with any tools/training for productionization of models). 

This left me feeling like I was falling behind the curve and wasting time in this role. I applied (for about 6 months!) and recently landed a role in a tech company working in a really skilled team with a really good tech stack.

My issue is, I hate it. The job itself if interesting and individually the team are kind and supportive, but there is a really toxic work ethic and it’s not what I’m built for. There is a level of knowledge that is expected that I clearly don’t have. The role is a mix of DS/MLE which seems to be the norm nowadays. I can handle the DS side well, but it’s the MLE side that I don’t understand and don’t really have the motivation to learn right now. 

I’m now in this weird spot where I have this job that looks great on a CV, but I feel as though I should’ve had another role in-between this one and my previous one where I can learn MLE and be better prepared for the stress this role brings.

Has anyone else had this experience when you have landed a job that is perhaps beyond where you are in your career? I doubled my salary with this move but that has been the only positive I’ve found, I wake up every day dreading work!

I realise I’m in a lucky position to have this job so I hope it doesn’t seem like I’m whining, I would just like to know if this is common, thanks!",False,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15gabl3/disaster_job_or_imposter_syndrome/,datascience

"Recently Was Assigned to a Job Rotation, Feeling Extremely Overwhelmed",15gk7w6,GetFkedPlease,1691008960.0,,False,True,Discussion,0,False,2,"I work for a large tech company in the semi-conductor industry. I was an EIC (Engineer In Charge) running a team of engineers for about 7 years doing field service work (modifications, troubleshooting, and analyzing etch semiconductor equipment).

Two years ago I began schooling for Computer Science B.S. Last September, I was offered a new role as a Data Analyst II doing remote diagnostics for the same tools I work on while I finish my degree (same company). I've been doing that and enjoying it, finding trends in the data and offering suggestions, etc. To better serve our customer. 

As of July, I was offered,  and began, a job rotation program with our data science team that creates data products for our diagnostics team (us). The goal was to be able to learn from them for six months, and then be able to make better data products for our data analyst team going forward since the data science team serves multiple teams and sometimes our basic requests are postponed for months.

This is my first real week. I work a total of M-Thurs. Monday and Tuesday as my normal analyst role, Wed. and Thursday are my job rotation days. 

I am feeling WILDLY overwhelmed though. I have no enterprise SQL or Python experience, just little projects I've made for our team and on the side through schooling. Today, they were like, ""ok, your task is to create a script that takes in csv files and manipulates them to be better ingested in X data base, and triggers anytime the csv files are populated into Y folder."" I haven't even touched SQL in like a year. They set me up with Azure Data Studio, and there are like 8 servers we are connected to, some SQLserver, some PostGres, which I know nothing about. I also have to learn about sprints on Monday.com, Prefect.com flows and managing/ troubleshooting pipelines as they go down, Power BI dashboard issues, and a myriad of other things. PLUS, I have 15 data products that are currently excel macros our analyst team uses to analyze our tool logs for diagnostics stuff, that we want to convert to a single standalone application all wrapped into one. This was the main reason I was brought into the rotation.

The main goal of this was the transition of the data products, but now I'm being stretched across like 40 different things. 

Wednesdays, we have 6 meetings, all an hour or more long, essentially leaving me like a total of 13 or 14 hours to do all of this per week. 

Like holy shit. I am going to set up a meeting next week with the data science manager to better establish a flow and goals, because I think there is a huge misunderstanding or something. I don't know how in the hell they think this is normal. IS THIS NORMAL? 

I need like a month (basically four of the Thursdays) just to do YouTube refreshers/ learning about all these different platforms, SQL, Python, etc. Just so I have some clue what I am looking at. I need to shadow these people while they're troubleshooting so I can see some sort of process I can follow.

Hey, Reddit commun`ity,`

`I hope you're all doin`g well! I'm seeking some guidance and reassurance as I'm about to start an MSc in Health Data Science and feel quite anxious about it.

Background :  
I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Science, achieving 1st class (UK degree) and have some cool experiences. I spent a placement year at an R&D laboratory and now work at NHS lab (as a band 3;-;). I also contribute to some research that leads to publications, which I feel is a decent accomplishment for an undergraduate student. Summarising, I enjoyed Biomedical Science because I could try many various things.

But now I graduated and ....job market is not great. It is scarily competitive and I feel like money is just not there. I feel like working in a laboratory drains me and after my whole academic endeavour, I still work mainly physically in the laboratory under senior scientists that do not really care about my existence so whatever. I feel like my brain is not stimulated at all and I just do one task over 8 hours and go home. I am far from being satisfied and it does not help that I work within laboratory of like 150+ workers and I am socially awkward .... xd. I started my biomedical science degree from just pure passion for biology and healthcare but now I'm just lost.

However, I have been thinking lately that I could do a degree in Bioinformatics or Health Data Science ( more interested in this one) to gain more skills and get more satisfaction from work. Additionally, maybe work from home in the future :D. So I got accepted for both courses but now I just feel anxious and I need some career advice/mental support as well.

So, basically, I feel anxious about starting this degree. It's not a matter of difficulty of the course because I am a hardworking individual but more of a lack of practical experience. When it comes to Lab, like it or not, I now possess 2 years of solid experience in that while not in Data Science. (The only thing I have is Admin/Data entry at hospital but it's not coding related at all).

So my questions are:  
Would it be possible for me to enter the health data science/ data science work area and climb this career ladder?  
I don't mind lowering my salary to the current one just for a healthier work environment in the future. Am I wasting my time and money on this degree? Is there any future within this?

Thank you in advance, all comments will be appreciated.

Discussion about the sub,15fcchn,magikarpa1,1690895800.0,,False,True,Discussion,77,False,169,"Hello, y'all. I've been wanting to address this question for some time now. The sub is slowly changing to r/learndatascience. We get the same questions posted here everyday (sometimes several times on the same day):

1. What degree should I get?
2. How much math should I learn to work with DS?
3. How can I get the first job?
4. Will IA replace DS jobs?
5. Now and then also there are the ""I don't like math, how can I work with DS"", or the ""do I really need to learn advanced math?"" where by advanced math people mean linear algebra and calculus.

I understand that these are honest questions, but they have been already asked billions of times. Also, it is kind of astounding how people want to work with a technical field, hence you need to be constantly learning things and searching for answers, and yet they don't even bother to search if the same question was already asked on the sub. I mean, this is not even hard to do, you don't even have to be on reddit, just post on google reddit + question and google will show the it.

In my opinion this is bad for the sub as an online forum. Compare, e.g., with stackexchange. If a question was already asked people will shut it as duplicate and link to the previous post where it was already answered. This is bad, imo, because, it floods the sub and prevents people from having good discussions about the topic of the sub. I mean, it is quite some time that I don't see a real DS post here.

I know that it can sound like a rant, but I understand r/datascience as a forum where people go to talk about DS and honestly I miss seeing these posts, e.g., people talking about how they solved some particular problem, talking about research papers and etc.

And last but not least, I know that DS was hyped and people think that it is the new ""dev"" job to get easy money. But I think that discuss this topic we would be better suited with a post just to address it.

My take: there is a moat in the knowledge and nuance needed to understand, create and interpret harder-core data science tasks. While it's easy to tell ChatGPT to analyze a dataset, there's a significant learning curve to being able to interpret the results of these tools, let alone do the iteration needed to produce an accurate analysis. However, I could foresee a lot of low-hanging data analytics jobs being disrupted/changed. Imo there's much less of a learning curve to writing SQL and visualizing data.

Career Advice for Undergraduate Students with academic-related DS experiences,15g9n0c,CompetitiveFortune00,1690984696.0,,False,True,Career,3,False,0,"Hi everyone! I am a rising 4th year undergrad student in US and I am looking for some advice on the direction I should be heading into next.

I've longed for a career in a finance-related/management consulting industry which need data science supports. I did not get exposed to much relevant experiences until Dec of last year when I joined the research team of one of the Economics Professors at my school. I've been working with the team closely on their projects and work through a few very interesting tasks (large-scale fuzzy matching with TFIDF vectorizer, building pipelines that downloaded, processed and analyzed NASA satellite data etc) while improving my Python skills (knowledge of **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**). This summer, since I couldn't find relevant internships that focus on data science, I have been staying with the research team aforementioned and working as an RA for another Professor on developing a interactive web dashboard with **Dash and Plotly** (I am the single developer in the team on the dashboard due my prior experiences). I've learned a lot more about Python, Pandas, Dash through these projects.

With my 4th year about to start, I hope to get an data analyst industry job out of school, but I am having doubts on my current skillsets since I've mostly been working in academic settings as described in my experiences above. In addition to the above experiences mentioned, I've been doing SQL (mySQL mostly) practices on StrataScratch with their medium and hard level questions (I find SQL rather easy to pick up after my long exposure to Pandas), and I have basic ML knowledge (traditional ML algorithms, RNN, CNN, their mathematical reasoning, respective fine-tuning parameters etc) from courses and books but not much practical experiences. **Am I on the right path here? What additional skills should I be acquiring?** And, if my skills are sub-ideal, do you think pursing a data science master degree for additional education and more time to prep for jobs will be a good idea?

Thanks!

However, I do really enjoy the type of work I am doing, so I would like to get an idea of the types of job titles that more closely align that. 

Here is a list of my responsibilities in my current role:

* Manage an outsourced team who write complex SQL queries for reporting and create BI dashboards. This includes defining projects, assigning tasks, prioritizing reports, and creating timelines.
* Presenting to executives to provide updates on projects, discuss feedback, and provide direction when they have a new ask
* Work with stakeholders to define business needs and then spec out reports and dashboards to provide actionable insights based on those needs
* Define the logic needed to align our data with our business processes and provide it to the outsourced vendor
* Data validation
* Write basic SQL queries for ad hoc data requests
* Create and tweak dashboards if they are simple or don't take too long
* Manage a different outsourced team to build out a company website to stick to the original scope of the project, conduct user testing, establish timelines, write messaging to communicate updates both internally and to our customers, provide training. There are three planned phases of this website that we are treating as three separate projects with three separate contracts and we are finishing up the first. I will do this for all three projects. 
* Work alongside an outsourced team as we build out our data warehouse.

I also make sure internal team members are finishing their project related tasks on time.

I am basically the subject matter expert for all our reporting capabilities and any projects related to that.

My current job doesn't really give me the chance to dive into that given the other resources we have dedicated to that and the time I spend managing projects.

The situation: I am an operations analyst Ineeded to give each agent the closest 35 customer for him to visit.

Solution : I used kmeans_constrained to cluster the retailers by their longitude and latitude and set the max size to 35 and that’s fine, it does decent job in terms of distances.

Con: it’s really random, it just gets the closest 35 customers to visit regardless of anything else.

So, I made a custom score for each customer (the higher the score, the better. based on a lot pf kpis) and then, injected some logic into the code to go in the highest score and cluster the customers based on their coordinates, if the total route size is less than 35 it goes to the next score, do the same and so on till it reaches 35.

Con: it’s even more random, a cluster of customers who share a given score does not necessarily mean they are close to the cluster of customers who are in a different score, making the total route distance bigger.


My question:
If I cluster the customers based on their coordinates and their score together would this improve targeting and optimize the distance? Does the data need to be standardized? As the scores range from 0 to n (maximum is 30) while the longitude and latitude ranges (30,31) .

I am delving into the exciting realm of GenAI and LLMs. I have a few questions I hope you can help me with:

1. When should I opt for supervised fine-tuning rather than prompt engineering with retrieval? 

2. What are the associated costs of supervised fine-tuning?

3. How many high-quality observations are typically required for successful supervised fine-tuning?

4. What are the frameworks and computional requirements usually involved in supervised fine-tuning, and how can I implement them in code? any tutorials available?

5. Can the model adapt and learn new jargon or specific tasks that might not be extensively covered during the pre-training phase?

&#x200B;

I understand that a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, with human feedback through a reward model, is considered the best approach. However, given that the latter method can be costly and falls under the domain of heavy research, it is probably less feasible for medium-sized organizations. Right?

Optimizing MongoDB Usage in Data Science: Tips & Tricks,15fmzzo,vishank97,1690919892.0,,False,True,Tooling,1,False,1,"https://preview.redd.it/eqg0eowd1kfb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b77b3e29da55e4712cfa0e7fbc910c0ae25fc0ee

As a Data Scientist, mastering database management is crucial for efficient data analysis and decision-making. MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, offers great flexibility and scalability, making it a top choice for handling large and complex datasets. Over the past two years, MongoDB has been an integral part of my professional toolkit, and I've gathered valuable tips and tricks that can elevate your MongoDB experience as a Data Scientist.

## 1. Create a Useful CRUD Wrapper

Working with MongoDB often involves performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on documents. To streamline your database interactions, consider creating a reusable CRUD wrapper. This abstraction layer encapsulates common database tasks and provides a cleaner and more maintainable way to interact with MongoDB.

    import pymongo
    
    def get_mongo_client():
        return pymongo.MongoClient(mongo_connection_string)
    
    # Create operation
    def create_document(collection, document_data):
        with get_mongo_client() as client:
            db = client[database_name]
            col = db[collection]
            result = col.insert_one(document_data)
            return result.inserted_id
    
    # Read operation by document name
    def get_document_by_name(collection, record_name):
        with get_mongo_client() as client:
            db = client[database_name]
            col = db[collection]
            document = col.find_one({""name"": record_name})
            return document
    
    # Update operation by document name
    def update_document_by_name(collection, record_name, updated_data):
        with get_mongo_client() as client:
            db = client[database_name]
            col = db[collection]
            result = col.update_one({""name"": record_name}, {""$set"": updated_data})
            return result.modified_count
    
    # Delete operation
    def delete_document(collection, name):
        with get_mongo_client() as client:
            db = client[database_name]
            col = db[collection]
            result = col.delete_one({""name"": name})
            return result.deleted_count

## 2. Master Aggregation Pipelines

MongoDB's Aggregation Pipeline is a powerful tool for data transformation, aggregation, and analytics. It allows you to perform complex operations on large datasets efficiently. Let's say we have a collection of sales data and want to calculate the total sales for each product category and sorting in descending order:

    pipeline = [
        { ""$group"": { ""_id"": ""$category"", ""total_sales"": { ""$sum"": ""$amount"" } } },
    		{ ""$sort"": { ""total_sales"": -1 } }
    ]
    
    result = list(collection.aggregate(pipeline))

## 3. Check for Duplicates Before Updating/Inserting

To maintain data integrity, it's crucial to prevent duplicate records in your database. Before performing updates or inserts, check if the data already exists to avoid redundancy:

    def update_or_insert_document(collection, data):
        existing_record = collection.find_one({""_id"": data[""_id""]})
        
        if existing_record:
            collection.update_one({""_id"": data[""_id""]}, {""$set"": data})
        else:
            collection.insert_one(data)

## 4. Utilize Indexes

Indexes play a vital role in optimizing query performance. Identify frequently queried fields and create indexes to speed up data retrieval:

    collection.create_index(""name"")
    collection.create_index(""category"")

## 5. Use Projections Wisely

When fetching data from the database, use projections to retrieve only the necessary fields, reducing network overhead and improving query performance:

    projection = {""_id"": 0, ""name"": 1, ""price"": 1}
    result = list(collection.find({}, projection)) 

## 6. Create Document-Specific Unique Identifiers

While MongoDB automatically generates a unique **\_id** for each document, consider using document-specific unique identifiers for certain entities like for stock market data, we can have unique record as the *stock symbol*. This can enhance query efficiency and ensure data uniqueness:

## 7. Implement Caching Systems

Frequent database queries can impact application performance. Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data and reduce query load:

    import cachetools
    
    @cachetools.cached(cache=cachetools.TTLCache(maxsize=100, ttl=300))
    def get_stock_data(symbol):
        # Fetch stock data from MongoDB
        return collection.find_one({""symbol"": symbol})

## 8. Maintain Data Integrity

Data integrity checks should include validating data types to ensure seamless interactions with MongoDB. MongoDB has specific data type requirements, and it's essential to preprocess the data before insertion to handle data types that MongoDB may not support directly.

For example, as you mentioned, MongoDB doesn't support **numpy.int64** data type. When encountering such data types, it's advisable to convert them to native Python types like **int** or **float** before inserting into the database.

    def insert_document(data):
        # Check data types and convert if necessary
        for key, value in data.items():
            if isinstance(value, np.int64):
                data[key] = int(value)
            elif isinstance(value, np.float64):
                data[key] = float(value)
    		collection.insert_one(data) 

## 9. Avoid Unnecessary Operations and Create a Master Dataframe

Minimizing unnecessary database queries is crucial for optimizing the performance of your data science applications. If your code requires data from the same database multiple times, consider querying the database once and creating a master dataframe to serve as a central data source.

## 10. Implement Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and maintain resource fairness, apply rate limiting to API endpoints interacting with MongoDB:

    from flask_limiter import Limiter
    
    limiter = Limiter(app)
    
    @app.route(""/get_data"")
    @limiter.limit(""10 per minute"")
    def get_data():
        # Query MongoDB and return data
        pass

By adopting these tips and tricks, you can harness the full potential of MongoDB for your data science projects. Understanding these best practices will not only make your code more efficient but also empower you to extract valuable insights from vast datasets. Embrace the continuous learning journey and explore the endless possibilities that MongoDB offers for your data-driven success!

Data Analyst leading Company out of the Dark Ages,15fm3dr,Significant-Analyst9,1690917834.0,,False,True,Career,2,False,1,"Greetings to my favorite subreddit!  Fellow data enthusiast here, and I am hoping to get your advice on long term career goals at my employer.

**My background**

My career started in accounting. Then pivoted to a variety of supply chain roles as an analyst. My roots are entrenched in Microsoft Products. Started as an excel monkey, then SQL neanderthal, followed up by Power BI human. Self-taught through most of it and as smart as stackoverflow allows me to be. Pursuing a MS in Data Science to get more grounded STEM knowledge and better combine with my domain knowledge.

**Courseload thus far and outlook**

\-Bachelors in Accounting

\-Udemy courses on Power BI, SQL, DAX, etc

\-Dataquest modules for Python

\-Pursuing MS in Data Science at Eastern University

**My employer**

Leading manufacturing of durable juvenile good in the US(strollers, car seats, high chairs, etc.). While we are technically an international company, we are very siloed and operate as a small-medium sized business. I am a data science team of 1. No real IT team in the US besides a 3rd party service that helps with day to day tasks. I am the data wrangler, cleaner and presenter from start to finish. I am the Power BI admin/developer and analyst for our business unit. Launched the reporting suite when I started with the organization 4 years ago. Before that launch, everyone was excel jockeying very disparate data sources often looking at the same number in multiple places.

**Infrastructure(image showing flow in the post)**

Limited to Microsoft 365 solutions.  I do have a lot of leeway when it comes to implementing new software. I just need to present the options to management outlining the cost/benefit analysis. Since I am a team of 1, It can’t be an infrastructure that requires multiple touch points. Emphasis on automation.

**The goal from my perspective**

I have gotten about as far as I can with low code solutions. Power BI is both our ETL and data storage solution which works for small datasets but will not scale well when data starts growing.

**Wants:**

\-ETL Process that is separate from Power BI. Needs to be easy to alter when data delivery methods change

\-Data storage solution that is scalable for growth and easy to access for a remote friendly company.

\-Foundation for more advanced data science practices(machine learning, neural networks, subject matter covered in later coursework.

**As an aside**, sometimes I receive advice to just change jobs to a more data driven organization. Not an option that I am willing to pursue. On a personal level, this is exactly the type of employer you want to have while raising a family.  I am compensated very well and the benefits to my family and well above average.  My wife and I are expected our 2nd child this year and I will have the luxury of having 12 week paid paternity.",False,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15fm3dr/data_analyst_leading_company_out_of_the_dark_ages/,datascience

To illustrate what this would be like, one of our engineers took a screen recording demoing our work in progress, which you can find in this blog post: [https://deepnote.com/blog/a-new-era-for-data-work-introducing-autonomous-deepnote-ai](https://deepnote.com/blog/a-new-era-for-data-work-introducing-autonomous-deepnote-ai).

TLDR at the end. 
I (28m) from India started my career as a support engineer (contractor) paid in pennies 9k INR pm in a MNC, became a SME after half a year. After a year asked my manager to make permanent, they couldn't so they moved me to a different project on the promise of making a direct employee of the company. Then covid struck, my managers were fired for their misbehavior, my hiring was paused. This was an hellish project wouldn't have time get of the system. Anger build up in me exploded after six months, during the peak hours I just said I wouldn't continue my work untill I am hired as direct employee. Then I was hired in couple of days and had a better salary (4LPA).
 Days passed learnt everything in the project, as seniors left I was made SME here, accepted it hoping it would be easier to my current role. I was totally wrong, all the people in the team started pinging me from shift start to end, I was given work by the higher ups, had to present performance of the team befor clients. I would work for 10hrs with no breaks. All work came to me because my managers didn't understand the product, absolutely no knowledge on it. I was baffled when my managers presented my ideas and views with the same words I used and no credits where given to me. These were the absolute worst I have seen or heard, not just not knowing the product, they have no management skills. People were denied leaves when family members were dead and asked to work as they had no backup planned. I became numb of this stuff and started learning data science after my after hellish 10hrs.
Took course after course was not able to crack interview, later landed a FS data science course. Mid way through the course I got an offer as a software engineer as I know to work with airflow.  I wanted leave this project so I made the switch without hesitation. After me  and my senior peers leaving the company, that project has gotten worse and would be ram downed in couple of months.

Now with 4yrs of experience in support background, I don't have the confidence to program though understand their code, I am rarely asked to work. 
Only given small tasks. Almost doing nothing. I am utilizing this time to learn and looking forward to make switch into data analysis or data science field.


My skills : python, aws, gcp, data viz, sql, nosql, ML, DL(learning), I would say intermediate level with all the skills

TLDR: support engineer hired as a software engineer after 4yrs doesn't have the confidence to code. Need advice to build confidence and switch into data analyst / data science field.

Is Data Science a viable career path going forward,15fllk8,lankmachine,1690916711.0,,False,True,Career,3,False,0,"Hi all,

I recently made a career switch into Data Analytics (I've been in my current role for 6 months) and originally my long term plan was to end up doing Data Science. I was looking for opportunities to go back to school and get a Masters in Data Science so I could pursue this path.

But I've started to worry about whether this is a good long term bet and if I shouldn't rethink this. I'm still pretty young and I can go back to school for something different or adjust my career path at this point (even though I wouldn't like to do this after having done it so soon). I debated maybe going back for an engineering degree (my bachelors is in Physics so I might be able to get into a masters program) or just finding an opportunity where I can work in engineering.

My main concern is that I hear a lot of noise about AI possibly shrinking the amount of data scientists that are needed going forward. Additionally, I've seen a lot of posts in this sub that have indicated that it's harder to get a job right now in the field. All of this has me concerned that this may not be a viable long term career path and I'll wind up with a decade into my career with skills that aren't particularly relevant.

What are your thoughts on this? I understand there's a lot of inflammatory media out there so my fears might be a bit inflated but some of the posts I've seen in this sub have had me concerned that this might be a real trend. Is all of this just hype or is there a real concern for data scientists going forward.

The reason this made me rethink my chosen major is that if there’s hardly any universities that teach this program as a bachelors then maybe companies who are looking to hire a data scientist need one with a MS degree and not a Bachelors degree.

And it's always been the problem with data science that some of the more exciting work where you get to do actual ""machine learning"" is kinda fenced off. Now some people are stuck. They spent time working on newly formed data science teams where not much ML was done, and they didn't get that experience. They only picked up the title. Without ML experience it's hard to pass proper DS interviews, let alone find them. Going to a data analyst role seems like a downgrade for those with DS experience.

Are AI Agents the future of content writing?,15fiom2,Competitive_Speech36,1690910239.0,,False,True,Discussion,1,False,0,"My journey in the IT startup world led me to some cool discoveries about AI agents and how they are changing the game in content creation. As someone who loves sharing knowledge, I'm excited to share these findings with you here. 

P.S. Feel free to write your thoughts and insights in comments

**Structure of an AI Agent**

An AI agent, in essence, is an autonomous program designed to perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. It's independent and not directly controlled by a human. These agents can be reactive or proactive, operate in fixed or dynamic environments, and exist as standalone entities or part of multi-agent systems.

Architecturally, an agent combines a perceptual apparatus (sensors) and operational mechanics (actuators). For example, a software agent might use keystrokes, file contents, and received network packets as sensors, while screens, files, and sent network packets function as actuators.

**How AI Content Agents can Help you: Use Cases**

One of the most intriguing uses of AI agents lies in content creation. These ""AI writer agents"" are transforming the way we approach content production, acting as supportive tools rather than replacement for copywriters.

*Generating Content Ideas at Scale*

Imagine having a never-ending supply of content ideas – that's what AI writers offer. You just feed them your keywords or topics, and they'll churn out numerous potential ideas for blog posts, social media content, or YouTube descriptions.

*Finding Meaning in Data*

AI writers can sift through massive amounts of data and distill it into insightful, actionable information. From analyzing novel manuscripts for style and structure to summarizing long texts, AI tools are steadily getting better at finding meaning in data.

*Overcoming Writer’s Block*

AI writing tools offer solutions for writers struggling to progress. They can generate content ideas, build out paragraphs, or even provide next-sentence suggestions based on the context of your writing.

*Technical Writing*

For technical writing, AI content generators can create comprehensive technical documents, white papers, webinars, ebooks, and more. They assist with researching the topic, drafting a well-written summary, and even improving the text's structure and grammar.

*Revising*

Finally, tools like Quillbot help copywriters revise their work, identifying and fixing issues, allowing them to focus on more significant structural issues.

**How to use an AI content agent**

To leverage an AI content agent effectively:

1. Choose a familiar topic or niche.
2. Select an AI content generator that specializes in that area.
3. Enter your keywords and relevant information.
4. Use the generated ideas, sentence suggestions, and more to produce your content.

**Choosing the AI Writer that Fits Your Content Generation**

Selecting the right AI writing tool depends on factors like your content generation time, budget, and the nature of your audience. Some popular options include GrowthBar, WriteSonic, CopyAI, and Scalenut.

I know a fair bit about Data Structures and Algorithms, Engineering Mathematics ( Calculus, Fourier and Laplace transformations, Regression etc ). My major programming experience lies in Python ( just far too flexible to miss out on ).

Now about my connection to DS, I first came to know about Machine Learning through a relative of mine and since then it has become a plateau of immense interest personally.

Now, I'm not extremely good at learning without really grasping the roots of a topic so when my course progressed to using these statistical tools, I was left wondering whether or not should I prioritise learning a bit about them first. 

Now, to the question at hand, as I near the end of my Bachelor's, I'm left pondering as to what career path to opt for that will benefit my progression the most. A Stats based Masters or a CS based Masters ?

Almost every learning resource will dive deep into how to train models to predict something, be it a continuous or a categorical variable. However it's almost impossible to find resources, examples or case studies on how the model was actually implemented. Like I get it, you have a forecasting model that predicts your revenue, and now what? Do you only use the model to show insights to stakeholders (which is actually really important) or do you try to simulate the response by changing an indipendent variable? Now, the latter part feels extremely difficult and under researched. I know you can run a/b test but they are obviously impractical, expensive and often do not exhaust the large amount of combinations.

Trapped in dev job after bait-and-switch,15dzi6j,wave-o,1690758570.0,,False,True,Career,23,False,67,"TL;DR: Took my first DS job, was moved to a software development team and now I'm stuck, because my current job doesn't give me the experience I need to move to the next DS gig.

So, I started my first job as a generalist DS ~1.5 yrs ago (following an unrelated PhD), but after ~6 mo, the company pulled a bait-and-switch and ""temporarily"" moved me to a software development project due to a ""shift in priorities"" and because I ""know Python"". 

Now it's been a year and I still find myself in a scrum team fixing bugs, adding features to our app or wireframing UIs. Naturally, I've been looking for a new DS position, but without much success, i.e. few take-homes or technical interviews.

The main hurdles, in my view, are that
• Interviewers get suspicious when they see that I've been at my current company for such a short amount of time,
• I've gained virtually no experience directly relevant to DS (only worked on a data pipeline / reporting project for the first few months).

To address the first issue, I usually give a canned response, when asked about my motivation to move. I would say that I've been working in a software development project because it creates the most value for the company at this time. That I really appreciate this experience because good development practices and cloud technologies are so important for modern DS workflows, but that I prefer working more hands-on with data to solve concrete problems for stakeholders. In my view, that's quite positive and logical, but maybe this could be improved?

The experience issue is harder to fix. The only way I see atm is to go back to doing personal projects and applying to entry-level jobs. Since I don't have the energy for this while working full time, I'd have to save up for a few months and then quit my current job. That carries a certain risk, but I'd bite the bullet for a chance at a job that's more up also.

 *I want to prove the red dots are not just randomly located in the landscape but always situated in relation to yellow dots.* 

I already have the coordinates of all the points so could easily do this via distance measurements between each point.

I've been reading papers and there seem to be **a couple of options** (none of which are explained very well, and I'd love some more clarification on):

1. Use a Monte-Carlo simulation \[Vanacker et al. 2001\] to prove red dots are not randomly situated. Apparently Vanacker converted the distance measurements between points into categories eg. <10km, 10-15km, 15-20km etc. But they didn't include a very good method or any of their code in the paper so I can't tell exactly how that would work and am struggling to find other examples/resources
2. Point Pattern Analysis since I am dealing with 'environmental coviariates' = second-order properties? \[Kempf & Gunther 2023 say they: ""used spatstat package in R and function rhohat to calculate site intensity as a function of the pre-processed focal raster data to visualise the effect of attraction or repulsion given by a specific parameter...""\] Why do they need to convert point data to raster data for this analysis?
3. Multivariate Regression since this would allow me to include other variables like elevation, distance from water source, soil type etc

The thing is, f1 and g1 represent the same quantities but from different events. Similar is the case with f2,f3 and g2,g3 respectively.

If I have to make the whole thing clearer with an example, consider that f1 and g1 represent goals, and f2 and g2 represent assists from 2 different footballing(soccer) events.

I'm doing this because I want the data from A to have a weight of 'alpha' and data from B to have a weight of (1-alpha) in the final data respectively.

Survival Analysis using Markov Chain,15egjb2,Common_Election_8646,1690810832.0,,False,True,Projects,2,False,1,"Survival Analysis using Markov Chains methods.
 

Good morning everybody, we are trying to model patient survival using Markov Chains methods. The process we want to model is the following: there are some patients who have to undergo a series of sequential visits within a treatment. Some of these patients complete the whole series of visits and therefore complete the whole treatment. On the other hand, other patients drop out mid-treatment after a certain visit (for unknown reasons). We are trying to estimate the probabilities that a patient who has completed visit n will also attend visit n+1. The idea was to model this process using a Markov chain. In this chain, each visit would correspond to a state, and we would have 2 extra states: one corresponding to treatment completed (in which the patients who complete the treatment will finish) and another to dropout (in which the patients who have left the treatment halfway through will finish). Using this model, the interested quantities are the elements of the transition matrix describing this process.
 
 
From a classical point of view, the estimator of those probabilities would be p_{n+1,n}=patients visit n+1/patients visit n, where we compute the number of patients who have records of visit number n+1 divided by number of patients who have records of visit number n. 
 
However, we would like to approach this problem from a Bayesian perspective, i.e., propose a prior for the transition matrix and update this matrix as patients go through the treatment. The need to do this relies of the fact that at the beginning of the process we will not have enough data to have reliable estimators for the transition probabilities.

I have no idea how to tackle the problem , do i use clustering methods or do i choose to go down the road of text analysis ( i'm thinking of spacys right now).

If someone already dealt with projects like those , i would love to hear from them !

Thanks

Seeking Ideas for Data Science Capstone Project - Focus on Fashion Industry or Soccer,15dw4ju,Lazy_Sneha,1690750297.0,,False,True,Projects,0,False,1,"Hello fellow Redditors,

I am presently working towards my data science degree and it's that exciting time for my Capstone Project! I am eager to start, yet I find myself in need of a little guidance to narrow down my ideas.

I have a profound interest in both the fashion industry and soccer, and I am keen on exploring a project that dives into one of these areas. However, I'm a bit uncertain on the specifics of what direction to take, what questions to ask, and how to structure a compelling and comprehensive project.

For the **fashion industry**, some broad ideas I have include analyzing trends over time, predicting future styles, building recommender system or assessing the impact of sustainability efforts. I also consider using social media data to comprehend consumer behavior or understand the role of influencers in driving fashion trends.

On the other hand, in the realm of **soccer**, I am intrigued by the idea of building predictive models for game outcomes, examining player performance analytics, or studying the impact of different strategies and formations. Analysis of the relationship between financial investments in clubs and their performance is another area that I consider fascinating.

But these are just initial thoughts, and I feel there are much more exciting and challenging opportunities to explore in these domains.

I am reaching out to this diverse community for your valuable insights. If you have any suggestions on how I could narrow my focus, potential datasets to utilize, specific questions that could be answered, or any other advice on how to approach these topics, it would be incredibly helpful.

Also, if you've worked on or come across any relevant projects in these areas, I would love to hear about your experiences and takeaways.

I understand the potential of data science to provide meaningful insights and contribute to these fields, and I want my Capstone Project to be as impactful as possible.

Thanks in advance for your help and guidance!

I used to work at Company X (F500 company) as a co-op student for 3 years. I quit because i had other plans. These plans did not work out and I had to get another job as a co-op, and the next best one i could find was at Company Y.

There is a job opening for my old co-op student job at my old company Company X. Should i return?

I am currently working at Company Y (F500 company) as a co-op student with another co-op student. We have been tasked to work with OutSystems and PowerBI. They put me to task to mainly focus on OutSystems, and the other co-op student to mainly focus on PowerBI. But, they told me I would have the opportunity to also work with PowerBI for some time. But OutSystems is not really data analytics.

At Company X, my tasks were:
-Support in daily operations, e.g., in the evaluation of machine data
- Assistance in technical projects, potentially taking on smaller projects
- Operating data analysis of gas turbines, generators, and steam turbines
- Maintenance of engineering databases

Company Y alluded to the fact that there might be a possibility to transition the co-op position to a full-time position for me after working there for 1 year.

Company X, on the other hand, told me indirectly that it is difficult to get any entry level position at this company at this time and so far i have not heard of anyone doing so, except one guy who told me he converted his master thesis work to a full-time position there.

Company Y i only know and work with my department, which are 2 people. Thats my current network.

Company X i was working with other departments aswell, so I kind of could ask around and leverage that network to get any entry level job at Company X, preferably as a data analyst. But its a big risk and big IF.

The industry of Company X (gas and turbines) is closely related to my masters degree (aerospace engineering). 

The industry of Company Y (transportation systems, mainly trains) is not really an area of my interest.

Company X and Company Y are sister companies of the same parent company.

On a personal note, i miss my work, life and the people from Company X, thats why a part of wants to return just because of that. But i need to make a rational decision here, especially considering my future career growth.

What do you guys think? Should I risk it and return? Or stay put where I am and atleast get the foot in the door with Company Y, and then leverage it to get a position at Company X in data analytics?

So, here's my story. I have a PhD in Politics and during my doctoral journey, I found myself increasingly fascinated by data science methods. As a part of a mixed-method research on political narratives online, I even implemented an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. This experience piqued my interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its potential applications in political research.

Fast forward to now: I am contemplating diving deeper into data science to fill in my knowledge gaps and boost my capabilities, especially in NLP. My ultimate aim is to further our understanding of AI, its potential biases,  and the effect of online narratives on political events in a research role, preferably outside of academia.

However, there's a twist. I'm over 30 and conscious about dedicating what could be crucial career-building years to more academia, especially when I already hold a PhD. I'm exploring the possibility of juggling my research work alongside a Master's, but I'm wary of how this might be perceived - a downgrade or a strategic move?

But here's the kicker: the cost of a Master's where I live is quite affordable and could help me to strengthen my network, which adds another dimension to my consideration.

So, fellow Redditors, I turn to you. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any insights, experiences, or pieces of advice would be greatly appreciated.

Most suitable model for first ML project.,15d43pq,hansmellman,1690667770.0,,False,True,Projects,14,False,0,"So I’d posted a little while back enquiring about similarity scoring and Euclidean Distance and have been taking my journey with Python down a much more DS focussed path these last couple of months. 

The basic idea of the current problem set is that I have a database of draftees from an NFL simulation game, I have pre draft metrics such as combine scores and attribute estimates from my scout, what I’d like to be able to do is use an ML model of some kind to help me predict (or at least isolate a more refined range of outcomes for) the overall rating of that player (this is only revealed once they’ve passed the draft and pre season week 2).

As I’d been building up this database the data is already cleaned and easy to normalise. Overall I’d say that the average feature set would be around 10 features but some positions have less attributes and a couple have a few more, so it will vary slightly. I will isolate by position to do the predictions for ease and uniformity. 

I’d been toying with the idea of Ridge regression but that’s only because it’s the one that I’ve watched a few videos on and read about - I’m hoping people with more expertise might be able to provide me some insight and advice into some steps to take to help make this project start in the right direction! 

I did come up a basic ridge following along a tutorial and replaced it with my own data and the initial success rates were like 55% correctly predicting the overall rating within 5 point range either side. I’m still trying to wrap my head around MSE and Rsquared as error metrics too, to be honest I’m trying to wrap my head around all of it but I find the best way to learn is to try and do these things.

Conformal Prediction with Python (Uncertainty Quantification in Time Series Analysis),15ci845,Kujamara,1690603033.0,,False,False,Discussion,6,False,28,"Recently I discovered Conformal Prediction which in a nutshell gives you a prediction interval instead of a single point prediction for a given input.

As far as I understand it works like this (very simplified and I just started learning TS and CP so take everything I write with a grain of salt):

1. Choose forecasting model for single point prediction as usual (ARIMA, ES, NBEATS, NHiTS, etc.) and train.
2. Define significance level alpha (e.g. 0.1) so 90% of predictions lay within calculated interval.
3. Set coverage rate and iteratively calibrate prediction intervals using validation set for n steps.
4. Throw new data point into model and get prediction interval.

I am really interested in using this method of uncertainty quantification in combination with regression (for now). My goal is to find a swiss army knife for Conformal Prediction that features all relevant TS models + CP features and is easy to use and set up.

I've found these python libraries on github:
- neuralforecast
- mlforecasts
- statsforecast
- sktime
- river
- darts
- tsai
- LightAutoML
- MAPIE
- crepes
- fortuna

I've already researched a lot, but honestly, I feel a bit overwhelmed by the complexity of the maths, statistics and coding as well as terminology used in the documentation. So I am hoping for some experienced data scientists that could help me out with my questions below and provide a clearer picture on what approach to focus on.

1. What is your general opinion about Conformal Prediction? Is it worth digging into it for business related tasks? Is it empirically more valid than classical approaches or is it just hype?

2. Is there a difference between ""Probabilistic Forecasting"" and ""Conformal Prediction""? Is Conformal Prediction a more modern approach of Probabilistic Forecasting or is it a synonym?

3. Which of those above mentioned libs offer Conformal Prediction features? I've read that sktime for example ""only"" has probabilistic forecasting, so I'm unsure which library offers the real deal (in case that there is a difference between the two).

4. What are your favorite tools/libs for Conformal Prediction that include all relevant models and are easy to use?

5. What alternative approaches do you use to calculate Conformal Predictions for example when facing a regression problem?

I am very excited for your answers and sorry if I messed up any lingo or anything else! Feel free to correct me.

This person literally speaks poorly about someone who had the role as if they are an idiot yet this person is a senior data scientist at meta now. Person quickly got promoted to my managers role at half their age. This manager has been very toxic and our relationship got worse overtime that at some point they decided to move on and quit. This manager had to hand over work that we worked on together. To my surprise, the managers documentation is nothing like the code and the actual unit tests are made up numbers. 

Also my manager has gotten feedback on their work 3 months ago in regards to a database they built  and the manager ignored the businesses feedback on how their assumptions are wrong and do not represent the data. Any actions of me trying to do work for the business contact was halted. My manager then proceed to use me as a punching bag as well as usage of derogatory language and to throw me under the bus. All the while nothing was done for the client. I ended up having to talk with their manager as they sabotaging and ended up having to report to their manager to show my actual merit. I ended up impressing people with my work. With everything going around my manager decided to quit, given that i have to take over the project we are working on together. I realized that the documentation is nothing as actual code. In fact there are many mistakes which are true to the businesses concerns and nothing was fixed. Now the responsibility of fixing the disaster is on my shoulder. Also the datasource the manager has put the work is being migrated despite the fact that we set up the database on a deprecated datasource. I have walked the new manager through the work my old manager did and the new manager believes that this is a disaster.

I am not sure how i can handle the datasource?

For context:
My old managers problems include

Aggregating strings through alpha numeric ordering where different categories have completely different behaviors

Averaging things that shouldn’t be averaged

Summing things that have duplications and reporting that the sums do not show duplicates through sense check. Only when you actually add up the numbers you will see the errors.

0 documentation in the actual code to explain what is going on

redeclaring variables/tables then dropping them over and over. The concept of CTE does not exist to manager.

Just to cite a few examples. 

With all of this I essentially have to redo the work. Problem is that a lot of the labeling that my manager did for my model and work essentially is wrong because of all the errors listed above. While the number do sense check a bit, my managers work isn’t quite right and has been contributing very poorly to my model performance. 

Personal experience is that 1) some managers cant code for shit 2) never give a data scientist a data engineers work sometimes the damage is harder to fix especially when reports are established",False,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15cjb00/how_do_you_deal_with_incompetent_managers_who/,datascience

Feeling Maxed Out - Need STEM Degree?,15c3amw,lordkhamul,1690564395.0,,False,True,Education,9,False,5,"Have a question for the group. I have a lead data scientist-level role at a major non-tech company in a big market that isn't San Francisco or New York.

I've been out of school for quite a while and didn't start my career as a data scientist - transitioned from analyst / BI type roles and learned data science skills along the way. I've got very strong skills in multiple SQL platforms, can develop models in Python and R, and have great presentation and visualization skills. I've built and managed teams and pushed models to production.

I'm at the point in my career where I want to get to the 'next level' - a Principal or Director role that pays $200k+. However, I've sent out dozens of applications for these jobs and never even get contacted by a recruiter.

Here's the problem - I don't have a STEM degree. My concern is that there are many people in the same boat as me applying for these jobs, and that I'm automatically screened out by recruiters because they filter out people without that credential. 

I know the consensus on this page is that skills and experience matter more than degrees and certifications, but I don't think thats the case for non-data scientists hiring people for data science leadership roles, for a couple reasons:

\- Most jobs I look at say 'PhD in a STEM field preferred, masters required' which feels odd for roles where candidates will be 10+ years out of school. I get the impression though that the Business Leader / VP types who hire for these positions like to be able to say ""we hired a new leader for our ML group who has a PhD in XX.""

\- When I have conversations with HR at my company for recruiting for roles I hire for, they are often overly focused on the degrees that the candidates have rather than their actual experience and skillset. That leads me to believe that the same thing is happening to me when people are reviewing my resume and its getting tossed in the trash without further consideration.

So I'm wondering whether its worth it to try to do a stem masters degree of some sort in data science or a related field just to get the credential for my resume. I question whether its really worth it to do a masters in data science or analytics at this stage in my career ... but I don't want to go another five years without getting to the next level because I'm missing this piece.

I feel like a data science masters would mostly be review and not a great use of my time, but I also am concerned that without it i'm effectively maxed out and won't be able to progress to the Director / Senior Director / VP-level analytics roles that I'd like to get to.

I don't have a ton of bandwidth, but I could probably do a degree part time over 2-3 years. Since I'd be mostly looking for the credential, I'd be looking for something with a relatively light workload. My employer would pay $5k a year in costs so would be looking to keep the total amount close to or under that.

I've looked at the UC Boulder Data Science program, the Georgia Tech Analytics program, and also the MIT Statistics and Data Science micromasters certificate. Other programs I've looked at seem too expensive. Are there other programs I'm missing that are relatively cheap and have a lighter workload to get through the courses? Again, I'm primarily looking for the credential, and will use the program to fill some gaps in my knowledge but I don't need/have time for the most rigorous possible coursework.

Does anyone at the leadership level have advice? Anyone gone through a similar situation? Am I wrong that the degree is what's holding me back and there's something else I should be focusing on?",False,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15c3amw/feeling_maxed_out_need_stem_degree/,datascience

I first  modeled this as a binary classification problem with the intention of  using feature importance to identify the configurations that may  lead to a crash. But the resulting model does not have good precision for the minority class (after class balancing with xgboost it’s around 0.45). (I tried few other classification algorithms too)

Since my objective is not to develop a classifier, I am trying to figure out what other techniques I can employ here. For example, model agnostic feature selection methods, outlier detection,  bayesian nets etc.

I’ve done a fair amount of stats, linear algebra, and Python/MATLAB/R/Java in my degrees, with some ML. 

In my domain, I focus on numerical hydrodynamic/hydrologic modeling and CFD. My thesis will be incorporating ML into the modeling process to help improve the accuracy of certain models given the huge array of data now available.

But as I consider finding my second DS* position, this backstory presents a slight dilemma.

I just updated my CV, cutting out *everything* that's not relevant to DS, except for my undergrad and grad degrees. In its place, under ""*Recent* Work Experience"" I went all out listing absolutely every little thing I have done since 2019. But then I realized that this leaves a huge chunk of time unaccounted for on my CV. Someone who looks at it might think ""Great, this guy meets DS requirements X Y and Z - but damn, what was he in prison for a while or something?"" Lol. There's just no way for them to know what I spent the years between school and 2019 doing, based only on the info in this DS CV.

My rationale for cutting so much was obviously the concern that it would add nothing to the strength of my application, and perhaps even make it weaker. I also *really* want to stay away from the field of education... But now I'm questioning this decision, and wondering if there is still some merit to mentioning - even if only briefly - all the other stuff I've done. If for no other reason than to show that I have in fact been gainfully employed for my entire adult life.

With the large number of people who have entered DS later in life or through non-traditional routes, surely I'm not the only person who has faced this. What are your thoughts? What have you seen?

\* Technically my field is ML engineering, not stats or DS proper. But there is obviously huge cross-over between all these, and anyway this detail is irrelevant to my question, so I'm not splitting hairs.

**Edit: Important clarification -** It wasn't like I moved from pumping gas into DS. The jump wasn't *that* extreme. Rather, pre-2019 I was working in language education, and now I work in NLP. So interest in language is the common thread. It's just that my previous work had nothing to do with coding, math, stats, data, or anything remotely DS-like. Although the domain has always been language, the minimum viable skill sets for my pre- and post-2019 work are completely non-intersecting.

**Edit: Less important -** “Education” here does not mean “teaching”. Sorry for the confusion. I was a researcher actually, focusing on standardized testing, classroom interventions, and other things of import to students and teachers alike.

What is the most in demand skill for a data scientist, in your opinion?

1. The technical skills, such as the ability to productionize ML models as well as knowledge of big o notation, distributed systems and security.
2. The statistics skills, namely traditional statistics such as experiment designs, hypothesis testing, A/B test, sampling, bootstrapping
3. Domain knowledge, including business knowledge and understanding - allowing you to see \*WHAT\* problems to solve to generate profit and why.

Personally, I believe most companies prefer someone who is more technical than a statistician, because a model that can't be deployed and integrated into a real system, provides 0 value. I also think that people who have the domain knowledge trumps both, as long as they have enough skills to provide good-enough models.

And let's be honest, 80% of data scientists couldn't code their way through an interval scheduling question even if you put a gun to their head. And that is the same as failing addition in math.

He’s giving me and a colleague a lot of free reign in designing this, but there’s a boundary he’s set that I think will make this endeavor hard: he wants the course in the math department, not the computer science department, so it wouldn’t be co-taught with CS teachers and would not have a CS prereq. Extending that, the course we design should be very Python-lite or even Python-free. He basically told us that we should build this course to be accessible to kids who have no coding experience whatsoever 

My concern is that this would severely limit our ability to make a meaningful, rigorous course. The more I dive into everything, I feel like the coding aspects are an integral part of the field. I’m not convinced that you can get by with just excel, codap, etc. It already feels like the black box of ML will be impossible to teach, and I don’t know how I feel about watering down the technical aspects to that degree

2. While I did enjoy learning about the applications of Machine Learning, I found myself enjoying my Computer Science courses more than my Statistics ones.
3. I came across opinions stating that Data Science is better pursued at the Master's level, and many internships and jobs in the field required a Master's degree.

My main concern is that switching to CS might require an extra summer to complete my degree. However, I'm unsure whether I want to work as a Software Engineer (SWE), pursue a career in finance and investing, or venture into Management Consulting.

The dataset is both sparse and wide. The task is to cluster users based on their product purchasing history. 

Based on some recommendations from here, I first applied max abs scaling, then into UMAP to reduce dimensionality, then GMM to cluster, much better results than other algos (and using PCA before to reduce dimensionality).

Here's the problem - my retail chain operates in different countries. The products are different in each country, therefore the sku is different and so any given customer will have 0 in common with a customer from a different country. Problem is they keep ending up in clusters together. And customers from the same country are in clusters of their own. My intuition is that it's because these customers are equally dissimilar from everyone else and thus ending up in the same cluster, problem is it's useless in the real world.

Initially, the job was excellent and I got to learn all aspects of a data analyst/data science role i.e. I have done end to end work related to data engineering, data science, business analytics and a bit of ML ops.

But lately, I feel like I need a masters degree in Data Science to further progress in my career as I can feel the difference in knowledge between me and my friends who work in Data Science roles in bigger companies. Another main reason for a master's degree is that I want to settle abroad in Canada/EU.

But there are two things which are making me doubt myself with regards to applying for a master's degree in those countries:

1. My Bachelor's degree is in Biotechnology which is unrelated to CS (although I did have a couple of CS and statistics related subjects in my coursework).
2. My GPA is not the best (7.6/10 overall and 8.6/10 in the final year).

While looking at profiles of people who have gotten admitted into decent universities in Canada and EU, they all seem to have a high GPA and related bachelor's degrees. So I automatically feel underqualified to apply even though I meet the minimum requirements that most programs have.

My question is - Would the work experience make up for my grade and my degree being unrelated to CS or would I be better off applying to easier to get into programs instead?

"How do layers and neurons of an ANN go from capturing small edges, lines, and curves to capturing more intricate and bigger patterns building on top of small patterns?",15b0cvx,Total-Opposite-8396,1690460225.0,,False,True,Discussion,2,False,0,"Lets say we have built a neural network that identifies a number from 0-9 in a 28x28 pixel image. Now lets say we have multiple neurons in the first hidden layer, and the first hidden layer might capture small edges, lines and curves in the image, and then the second hidden layer might build on those small edges, lines and curves to build bigger shapes, and then so on, the third hidden layer builds on the shapes from the previous layer, to capture more complex and bigger patterns in the picture, and this goes on until we have reached the output layer to make a prediction.

Now in this neural network, lets focus on the first hidden layer where different neurons capture small edges, lines, and curves in different parts of the image. Lets take example of one of the neuron and see what it's doing to do so. 

\- So the neuron receives an input of 28x28 = 784 features.   
\- Each feature is a gray-scale value of the pixel ranging from 0-1.  
\- Each of the 784 features, get associated with some random weight and bias.

Now to capture small shapes, in a small region of the image, it is important that we assign larger value of weight to the pixels of that small region, as compared to the other pixels that are out of that region, so that the neuron focuses on the small region of the image to capture small shapes, like lines, curves, and edges etc.

Now all features are assigned random weights and different weight for each neuron in the first hidden layer, and thus each neuron focuses on different part of the image and capture different small shapes from that image.

From all this, I have 2 question:

1. The workflow of the neural network from input layer to the first hidden layer, that I've explained, is it the right intuition of how the first hidden layer captures small shapes, lines, curves, etc...?
2. Even though we set larger value of weights for some features, so that our neurons focuses on small region of the image. While optimizing using gradient descent and back-prop, wouldn't the weights be evened out so that the neuron can no longer focus on that small region of the image?

In my second interview, when I asked about the possibility of remote work, their response was vague. They asked me to complete the assignment first, saying ""we'll see what we can do."" I've spent three days on this task already, and it's not finished yet.

My concern is that these lengthy assignments might be a waste of time if companies aren't considering critical details among the top lines of my CV beforehand. This process has led to disappointment and unnecessary time investment as you can imagine.

Is this a common practice in the data science field - giving extensive tasks before a thorough CV review? While these are the only interviews I've managed to get so far, I want to ensure I'm using my time well.

Unsure as to what data science internships will ask in the technical interviews,15asd2j,jexpearce,1690433922.0,,False,True,Career,2,False,0,"Hey,

I was wondering what topics would be covered in the interviews, specifically for the internships aimed at undergraduate students in their 3rd/final year of university. I've got a very good grasp of SQL, Python, and Pandas, and have just started looking at a machine learning course but I'm just not sure if my statistics knowledge is up to the standard.

Not only that, but like what type of questions would they ask? Would it be like the traditional SWE internship questions that are kind of like the ones on leetcode? What technical questions could you even ask for a language like SQL or for Pandas? Would it be more statistics based? Would it be more theory like ex. why is a random forest supervised learning?

For example, I'm looking at the Data Science Analyst program by JP Morgan for next summer as a basis.

Is it time to switch company for my career growth ?,15a0lhp,Mybackhurtsalothelp,1690363018.0,,False,True,Career,5,False,15,"Hello fellow DS practitioners,

I have been at the same company for quite some time (5 years). It's a traditional multinational company I joined after school which has been fairly good to me in several aspect, not so great in others.

Pay at entry-level was very good (best offer I got back then) and also huge pay bump (I made +75% over 4 years) as well as a title promotion at my 3 years mark. People are nice, higher ups as well. Work conditions are fairly good.

The only real downside is that in terms of project content, I find the data science part to be lacking a lot and end up doing a lot of things (data engineering, devops, pure dev, etc ...) I dont really have a taste for. Sure there is a couple of DS/ML projects, which I have mostly been the one leading the initiative on (because it's fun but also because I think we can get value out of it). They both have been successful, and I've had received praises from higher ups (although tbh it wasn't anything crazy either in terms of technical innovation).

But somehow I feel like I've explored all that is to be explored at the company, and things are starting to be a boring routine.

I mentioned this to my manager yesterday and he told me about an opportunity to lead a major initiative in a subsidiary of the company abroad. He was honest about the uncertainty surrounding this initiative since it will be very exploratory and might end up being a complete failure. He also said this was a strategic initiative and that I was the only one considered for this position (they were actually going to tell me about it next week). The details are the following : I would first spend 3 months abroad to kickstart the project. If things are going smoothly on both sides, then I would go on for a longer period, maybe a couple of years.

I think overall, it's a great line of experience to have on a resume as it shows some sort of internal recognition to be sent in another country. And on a personal level, I think it's also a great adventure to have while still young and without a family to move around.

However, I'm wondering if I'm not putting myself in the position to be stuck later on, career-wise. I also want to have the experience of working in a tech company, doing cutting edge stuff. IDK if I'm fantasizing on this or if I'm just FOMOing.

I've started applying to some job offers couple of weeks ago. A lot of interesting challenges but it seems that my current salary is a notch above the market also, so I might have to sacrifice on that.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think I should do ? Stay at my current company where my work has been recognized by everyone, and where I'm generously compensated for it, or switch company for early-career growth ? Should I be considering this international opportunity that is very uncertain and will commit me for another 2-3 years ?

I find myself at a crossroads with regards to my career path and could use some insights.

Just for some background, I'm a PhD candidate in physics in California, but have recently taken a hiatus to explore data science roles at startups in Asia. This experience has led me to question my original plan of returning to finish my doctorate. Specifically, I'm grappling with a couple of uncertainties:

1. How significantly would not completing my PhD impact my market value in the U.S. data science scene?

2. I'd love to extend my stay in Asia, but the disparity in an average compensation packages here compared to the U.S. market seems pretty extreme. I'm particularly interested in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Would anyone be able to shed some light on whether this discrepancy in compensation extends to American expats like myself? Will I be able to bridge this gap by targeting US companies with a branch in Asia?

How to build up the necessary skills to be employable during a (pure) Math phd?,15ajsle,Math_Singer_6637,1690410212.0,,False,True,Discussion,3,False,1,"Ok I know this has already been asked, but I wanted to join the party. The thing is, I am doing a math phd in Analysis, in a quite theoretical subject. As many before and after me, I got into this hoping to continue the academic career, but where I live (western Europe), as in the States I suppose, the competition in VERY hard for VERY little places. Add this to

1. My results are not that interesting/relevant/strong to be competititve, and my topic of research is not ""hot"";
2. The prospect of having 5+ more years after the phd to MAYBE land a stable job is, in the very least, not appealing.

So I've come to the conclusion that I still want to complete my pure math phd (both for personal satisfaction, fun in doing what I do and to have a, possibly not so useful, title to add to the CV...) , but along the way I may as well prepare myself for what's coming after. Luckily, I still have roughly 2 years to finish the phd and there should be a more applied part to it (thesis-wise), but about that I still have to understand what to do precisely with the supervisor.

Anyway, looking online I guess my best shot is at Data Science/ML. I know a little bit of C (very rusty actually, took a course a few years ago and never used it ever again) , Matlab and Python and I always assumed I didn't like programming or Statistics, but the truth is: I guess I don't really dislike them, because thinking about it they've been taught to me in an EXTREMELY boring way for the programming part (tons and tons and tons of slides with little practice....), and in a very mathematically unsatisfactory way for the statistics part. The statistics professor basically told us a bunch of techniques without bothering to give examples or explain the theory behind it. So I was thinking that in these 2 years I could self-study some stuff, and maybe use some of it in the thesis to show off some work to the employeers.

Now, the question is: what are your advices? How would you approach the task? Moreover: do you know/have heard of people with similar stories? I don't regret embarking in a phd, because I wanted to give it a shot, and I tried really hard, but I also have to be realistic and be prepared.

So, to prepare for the world outside academia, I would do the following:

1. Learn (to some degree) Python ""in general"", through some online courses
2. Self study statistics from books, maybe with a little bit of R language (but what books? What statistics? I have no idea, the field is huge)
3. Learn SQL and data management, and something about Machine Learning algorithms in Python, to specialize some more

Maybe it's too much, I don't know, but ANY kind of advice/thought would be helpful. I also think of posting a similar question on the r/PhD, because probably there are people who've actually done this.",False,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15ajsle/how_to_build_up_the_necessary_skills_to_be/,datascience

For random common cause and data subset, the new estimate is about half the ATE value, between 40-50. For placebo replacement is between 18-26; this is in line with the lower confidence interval, and closer to what I would assume is the zero value for the model. 

I am using confounders like age, location, activity, a qualified level from segmentation, and the length of association with the company.

The role of a data analyst was in some ways more well defined previously. Where there are fewer possibilities, there are fewer expectations. Now, by the proliferation of tools and expansion of expectation, it blends increasingly with that of a data scientist. 

It’s now essential to have expertise in one or more programming languages, as well as database querying methodologies, both of which we’ll explore in more detail. 

Proficiency in R and Python, as well as knowing how to utilise DBT (data building tool). More on this [here](https://www.pl-talents.com/expertise-to-look-out-for-when-hiring-a-data-analyst/). 

Data analysts work with databases, so they absolutely need familiarity with writing SQL queries. PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

Additionally, data analysts can benefit from expertise with SQL-related technologies and frameworks:  SQLAlchemy,  Apache Spark SQL, HiveQL.

Data Visualisation and Storytelling tools. 

Working with databases is one thing, but data analysts need more than SQL. Data analysts now handle more complex and diverse datasets, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

Recently I've been working on a more generalized dataset collaboration tool that allows data scientists / ML researchers to quickly share datasets and model predictions with people they're collaborating with, without having to teach them how to get a Python notebook up and running. The main features we've prioritized so far are:

* Easily be able to upload slices of data directly from a Python notebook and then view them via a shareable browser link.
* Customize the way the data is displayed (e.g. changing text size/color, choosing to display examples in rows vs. a grid, and being able to custom render unique/complex data types).
* Easily search through and favorite, tag, or add notes to interesting examples in the dataset.
* Be able to interactively view examples where ground truth data differs from model predictions.
* Be able to share specific examples or subsets of data with other people you're working with without them having to replicate your Python notebook environment.

We have a quick demo [video](https://youtu.be/utkSCU2ktck) that walks through our current flow.

Low data volume,159qavy,Panthums,1690331289.0,,False,True,Discussion,5,False,1,"Hey guys, so I wanted to get your opinion on a particular problem.

Let’s say I have a dataset from a manufacturing environment which has very low volume (50-150 products per year). Each data entry in this set is a product failure, and the independent variables are the products serial number, failure mode, root cause/final fix of that particular failure as well as information on any part which has been replaced.

The product is very complex, it has several different systems and parts which interact with each other, so the number of possible failure modes, root causes and parts replaced far exceed the number of products manufactured each year. The same failure mode can have multiple root causes and the same root cause can have multiple failure modes.

Intuitively I question how much insight we can have from this dataset. Obviously we are always looking for more volume than the number of variables. Since multiple failures can occur on the same serial number, our data volume is one order of magnitude higher, but still seems to me pretty low. The categorical variables each have multiple hundreds if not thousands of categories.

And all that is excluding issues with data quality…

Given my objectives of reducing failure incidences (improving product quality), my questions are:
- Is there a way to quantify how much insight we can obtain (like translate data entropy into something management will understand)?
- Is this even the right way to look at this data or should we have a different dataset altogether?

Are there some tried and true methods to go about this? I am thinking of doing some nearest neighbor analysis and using some nearest neighbor algorithm could tell us which classes are likely to overlap but it might give us a heuristic on *how much* they overlap.

Hello all, thanks in advance for any comments I receive. 

I recently obtained my B.A in political science with a minor in international studies. My school offered a Qualitative Social Data Analysis Certificate that I decided to not obtain because of the way it played out for graduation and me not finding out about it until pretty much too late. I did take 2 political data analysis courses (concentrated in R) and I really enjoyed them. It was my first exposure to this and it was something I really liked which is then I found out about the certificate. 

I’ve been looking for jobs for about 10 months (really heavily for about 5) and have been unable to land anything. I have a year of applicable research experience that I have used to get me to the final stages of a few research orientated positions but was unsuccessful in obtaining them. So naturally I feel lost and am debating on whether or not go back and get some data analysis experience.

I’ve been contemplating on whether or not to go back to my school and obtain the certificate( it would only take 2 semesters) or to go through a data analysis boot camp that is offered in conjunction with my states school system. I’ve seen conflicting views on boot camps, many people say that you might as well just self learn but I think this boot camp is something that is really applicable to a resume as it’s attached to the state school system. Also the certificate is a good option but I’m reluctant to go back to school for this as I have some aspirations on going back to obtain my MPP (no set timeline but certainly wouldn’t be for 5+ years) so I’m conflicted on my options. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

While I understand the basic intent of each line, I'm curious about the specific differences and implications they may have on the resulting DataFrame.

&#x200B;

Here are the four lines of code:

&#x200B;

1. \`df\_cleaned = df\[\~((df < lower\_limit) | (df > upper\_limit)).any(axis=1)\]\`

2. \`df\_cleaned2 = df\[((df >= lower\_limit) & (df <= upper\_limit)).any(axis=1)\]\`

3. \`df\_cleaned3 = df\[\~((df < lower\_limit) | (df > upper\_limit))\]\`

4. \`df\_cleaned4 = df\[((df >= lower\_limit) & (df <= upper\_limit))\]\` 

I've noticed that the shape of the resulting DataFrame, \`df\_cleaned\`, is different from the others, and I'm trying to understand why.

&#x200B;

Could someone please explain the specific differences between these four lines of code? How does the use of \`any(axis=1)\` affect the filtering process, and why does it lead to different shapes in the resulting DataFrames?

I know it must be bewildering to see the title. But here is why I am doing this rewrite:

1. Personally, I detest OOP interface for machine learning tasks. Mixins are nonsense. All pipeline functions should be ""Functions"", as we are dealing with mappings between mathematical spaces (from space of dataframe to space of dataframe).
2. With the advent of dataframe package like Polars, there is absolutely no need to pass tasks to NumPy (for most of the daily tasks). This way, we pass dataframe in, we get dataframe out. Way better UX.
3. I want to use Polars (almost) entirely for my machine learning pipelines for performance reasons.

**How to become Data Scientist?**

**Part of a Data Scientist:**

As businesses induce further data than ever, it becomes clear that data is a precious asset. still, rooting meaningful perceptivity from data requires assaying the data, which is where Data Scientists come by. A Data Scientist is a specialist in collecting, organizing, assaying, and interpreting data to find trends, patterns, and correlations.

Data Scientists play an essential part in icing that associations make informed opinions. They work nearly with business leaders to identify specific objects, similar as relating client segmentation and driving advancements in products and services. Using advanced machine learning algorithms and statistical models, Data Scientists can examine large datasets to uncover patterns and perceptivity that help associations make sound opinions.

Data Scientists generally have a combination of specialized chops and knowledge of interpreting and imaging data. They must have moxie in statistical analysis, programming languages, machine literacy algorithms, and database systems.

Let’s have a look at an overview of the liabilities handled by a professional Data Scientist.

* Gathering, drawing, and organizing data to be used in prophetic and conventional models
* assaying vast quantities of information to discover trends and patterns
* Using programming languages to structure the data and convert it into usable information
* Working with stakeholders to understand business problems and develop data-driven results
* Developing prophetic models using statistical models to read unborn trends

structure, maintaining, and covering machine literacy models

* Developing and using advanced machine learning algorithms and other logical styles to produce data-driven results
* Communicating data-driven results to stakeholders
* Discover retired patterns and trends in massive datasets using a variety of data mining tools
* Developing and validating data results through data visualizations, reports, dashboards, and donations. [Data Science Classes In Nagpur](https://www.sevenmentor.com/data-science-classes-in-nagpur)

In conclusion, the part of a Data Scientist is critical for businesses looking to make data-driven opinions. Data Scientists are responsible for collecting, organizing, assaying, and interpreting data to identify trends and correlations. They also develop data recycling channels, design reports, and dashboards, and develop models to read unborn trends. To succeed in the field, they need to understand the business environment and the client’s requirements.

And because these were gonna be used for research papers and public articles, there were very little room for mistakes. Any work that wasn't finished was excluded from the next round of research, which made all my effort to be nothing.

There are also some dense reading and weekly meeting notes to go over, and this is the part that I despise the most; I already got my hands full with writing scripts in R or cleaning data in excel; Now I also have to do some dense reading?

* What do you think are the reasons for this?
* How is the profession becoming hyper-specialised (arrival of MLOps, vision specialists, etc.)?
* With the arrival of 'packaged', low-code solutions from big tech, which could be suitable for 80% of projects, do you think 'home-made' DS solutions have a future? Is there a paradox here with the hyperspecialisation mentioned above?

I cant just map this with normal code, because this needs to be done for many different companies with many different financial account names.

Which models would be suitable for this? I am a software developer with a little academic background in machine learning, but dont have too much practical experience in ML.

Been stuck on a problem. Just need to know whether this problem statement is solvable or not.,15753qp,CrypticTac,1690087252.0,,False,True,Projects,25,False,95,"I've been stuck on the following problem for weeks now. To be clear I'm not asking the community to provide a full solution. Just a few ideas or at least confirmation on whether this problem statement is solvable with the data available at hand. Thanks.

**Context:** I work for a company that rents out stuff. During user checkout, there's a rule-based risk engine that determines whether to auto-approve user (takes seconds) or send for manual approval (takes days). This engine utilizes only basic features such as credit score, rent items category, cart value etc. Lets say that around 40% of all instances go to manual approval. Actual rejection rate is around 1-2% that means most of the cases sent for manual approval could have just been auto-approved.

**Objective:** Reduce dependency on manual approval as much as possible (to lets say 5%). If this was a binary classification task (manual or not) then we'd say recall is important here. Thus, deprecate legacy system as it is too rudimentary.

Now, boss wants me to achieve this by creating a regression model using customer credit history, and purchase history to predict ***maximum allowed***  ^(†)***active-sourcing-cost per user***. So that if a user tries checking out cart that brings their total active sourcing cost above their max allowed limit, they will be sent for manual approval instead of auto-approve.

>^(†)*active-sourcing-cost is the total purchase cost to company of all items the user currently is renting*

**Data available:** User purchase history, user credit history (experian), product details, NPA data (data of users who failed to return the items they have rented, thus defaulted)

**Issues with proposed solution:**

1. Max allowed sourcing cost per user unavailable as the target variable (No recorded ground truth for any samples)
2. No relevant proxy variables available as ground truth (that I can think of)

Tried explaining that lack of relevant ground truth is an issue. But am being pushed for a solution so have to produce.

**My alternate half-baked solution:**

1. Use legacy system for auto approvals only. This acts as a filter.
2. To the rest of the data that would otherwise be sent for manual verification we add NPA users and tag as a negative class. This would be the training data.
3. Train binary classification model (npa vs. not npa).
4. What the model classifies as NPA would then be sent for manual, rest will be auto approved.

[P] I created a parallelized implementation of Agglomerative clustering that's many times faster than existing implementations and has a better runtime,157bax6,Ridaleneas,1690108031.0,,False,True,Projects,1,False,23,"I've been working on a new implementation of Agglomerative clustering called Reciprocal Agglomerative Clustering (RAC) based off of this paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11653](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11653). The short of it is Agglomerative clustering can be broken down into finding and merging pairs of reciprocal nearest neighbors in parallel, as long as the linkage function is one of the following:

* Single
* Average
* Complete
* Ward

Most importantly, RAC *produces the exact same results as traditional Agglomerative clustering when the dataset is fully connected.* Even with connectivity constraints, the results are almost always the same.

The authors showed that RAC has a linear runtime when connectivity is limited to k and the distance matrix is precomputed. I have not added the ability to pass in the distance matrix yet, so the runtime is roughly quadratic, which is still a major improvement over the cubic runtime of Agglomerative clustering. In addition the entire algorithm is parallelized, and so can scale up to more and more cores.

It's very much in development - only average linkage works at the moment, however, I think it has a lot of potential. The benchmarks have blown me away so far:

Looking for Resources/Opinions around R and Team Building,157pgxl,mathblaster69,1690144386.0,,False,True,Discussion,3,False,2,"Hi All,

I will be leaving my Job at a startup in about a month to go to an organization and start a data science team. I currently run a analytics and data science team, and I like to think that I do a good job understanding the business problems and data and coming up with solutions. I have built this team up from basically scratch (my boss hasn't been very involved in analytics as he's focused on other things) and have hired all 15 people under me. Our company has been relatively successful through the pandemic and its largely because of our analytics solutions. However we are in the healthcare space which means that most of what we have done is revolving around SAS.  

As mentioned, I am going to be moving to a new organization which (seems to) have realistic expectations about applying data science.  Ill be building a team from scratch, which I have done before, but they mentioned they are primarily an R shop, which I haven't used since college. I was wondering what your best resources for learning R's applications to data analytics and Data Science were. I'm a very hands on person and as discussed in the interview 50-75% of my time will be hands on over the next year or two as I learn company and their goals so I want to be able to hit the ground running 

Additionally, if anyone has any good resources on building teams (data science or non data science) I would love to read those as well. I am always looking to get better and since my last job started as analytics and grew into data science, I assume starting with data science might be different.

Mostly i get the info for new developments from street naming and numbering department when they apply for an address.

The local commercial tax and residential tax departments plus the waste departmentsadminister all this but there is not much synchronisation. They don't have a common identifier for the property for and sometimes the address format might not match exactly so hard to match like for like. Talking about 100k properties.

He also mentioned that I am sometimes slow. For instance, I should ask the questions I ask way earlier in the project.  


I know he is partially right. I haven't been up to par but I think the real reason is that I don't feel valued in the company. When I started I was very energetic. I used to do a lot of overtime and suggest ideas. I used to put extra effort into what I was doing. fast forward some months, and I started to feel worthless, people never listened to my ideas, and they never acknowledged my extra work. The worst thing was when I got requests from my lead without any consideration of my time, or asking politely. I started to do the bare minimum and I think this is the reason I am always reactive and not proactive. I don't prep anymore, don't suggest ideas. I just survive. I realize my company is a BS seller.

I am a current student obtaining my MS in Health DS. I have about just under a year left of the program at a respected, private, American University. I have gained experience in understanding databases and their relationships, SQL, and heavily in R and Python for data analysis/statistical analysis/inference modeling. My undergraduate work was done in Kinesiology/Biology 

After trying my luck into finding a decent job to find some experience related to DS (Have worked in bars all my life and realize an internship is the least of what I need to gain experience for a first gig after the program), I have successfully landed an interview for a Data Specialist at a local hospital, after a reference from a former internship supervisor. 

My question is: What type of questions/difficulty will I face in the interview? I hear a lot of stories of people going in either unprepared or not expecting the level of knowledge asked about. Don’t get me wrong, I study hard and am pretty knowledgeable about the field in what I have learned so far, but want to succeed in this interview.

The job description mostly states the primary job would be to maintain hospital databases. The qualifications are only “someone that possesses an Associate’s degree” and “high computer skills”. 

Should I be worried and study up? If you have any knowledge about what a “Data Specialist” position does daily I would love to hear, as well.

My three ideas for how to organize and manage this data are as follows. 

1. Load them into a python dictionary. The first string would be the key and the second the value. This would make it easy to access and filter by key but the key is really only useful for confirming I've got all the data I'm after. Once it's downloaded I'm much more interested in the values. 

2. Load them into a pandas df. A single data frame would make it easy for me to get some of the information I'm looking to gather out of it. I could include a column to verify I got everything with the first string and then move to a second df to do the actual work. Dropping the first column in the process.

3. A numpy array. This would allow for me to do the most thorough check on the data once it's scraped. Instead of having a column for the first string I could create a multi dimensional array with a new dimension for each subset. I would expect around 400 dimensions.  This feels unwieldy to me but may prove the best way to ensure I have exactly what I'm after. 

What do you guys think? How would you store this? A parquet file? I'm more of a hobbyist at this.

The problem isn't that I can't find what to do, but I'm not sure how much of my projects should be ""inspired"" from the sample projects (like the ones here: https://github.com/firmai/financial-machine-learning). 

For example, I want to make a project where I can scrape the financial data from ground up, ETL, and develop a ~~stock price~~ predictive model using LSTM. Im sure this could be useful in self learning, but it would it look identical to 500 other applicants who are basically doing something similar. Holding everything constant, if I were a hiring manager, I would hire the student who went to a nicer school.

1) Recently completed BSc Mathematics and Computer Science at a top 10 UK university
2) Due to start a Statistician job at one of the government departments (pre-employment checks underway)
3) Pretty good background in Python and SQL, never touched R though.
4) I would consider my statistics background to be very decent (it was enough to land a government statistician job straight out of uni so I must have been doing something right which I'm very proud of)
5) Beginner in Machine Learning - only did a university module on it, however I enjoyed it massively and plan to take some more online courses this year
4) EU citizen living in the UK, no plans of relocating as of now

I am looking for some guidance from people who are already in the industry and more knowledgeable than me.

I'm not going to lie and say that money is not what I'm looking for - sure, I chose this path because I'm enjoying both Maths and Computer Science, plus I've always had a quite good understanding of data and programming. However, I have a lot of financial goals which I obviously want to achieve in a reasonable space of time. That's the reason I am happy I found this sub - I would be grateful for your advice on how to maximise both career progression and income.

Which direction should I take? My plan was to stay in the pure Statistics job for a year or two before starting looking for something more towards ML? Would you say this is a good move?
In which area I should be investing my time to improve?
Is doing a Masters degree in Data Science (or Statistics/ML) a good idea to accelerate my career path?

An Embedded GPT Assistant Contextualized by JupyterLab Notebooks,155wrrd,masnwilliams,1689965843.0,,False,True,Tooling,0,False,2,"Hey all!

Over the past few weeks, my colleagues and I have built a new feature in our JupyterLab plugin that allows you to converse with a chatbot contextualized with the code snippets in your notebooks. Notebooks can get large and complex quickly, so having a personal coding assistant as a partner at work, helping you find relevant information and answering your questions can be very helpful.

https://i.redd.it/369gz1w04ddb1.gif

The technology draws background context from the snippets in your notebooks to help augment the responses from the AI. This means you can empower the chatbot with all the code you have written within JupyterLab notebooks.

With each response, the AI links you to relevant files and suggests follow-up questions based on the context of your conversation.

We base all of our engineering on community feedback, so feel free to reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/5AN7rVXEES) or our [support survey](https://getpieces.typeform.com/jupyterlab) with any questions or comments and we will be glad to help.

If you’re interested, here’s how to get started! It’s just 3 easy steps and usually takes new users about 4 minutes.

1. [Install Pieces OS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing): This is the background service that runs locally on your machine and connects Pieces applications and plugins.
2. [Install the Pieces JupyterLab Extension](https://docs.pieces.app/extensions-plugins/jupyterlab#steps-to-install): This is the connective software that brings the power of Pieces straight to JupyterLab.
3. In JupyterLab, open the Pieces plugin by selecting the “P” logo within the right side-bar. Then, switch from snippet view ( {} ) to the AI by clicking the little robot. ( 🤖)

We’re so enthusiastic about this new creation and love the feedback we have already received. Keep it coming! (There’s also much more to this update than just the chatbot, you can find the full list of changes here!) After trying it out, what do you think?

Level up SQL Interview Prep with AI Workbooks – ChatGPT + Annotations + Collaboration,155ypfq,InevitableSky2801,1689970200.0,,False,True,Tooling,0,False,0,"I’m a former data engineer turned Product Manager but I still love querying data and doing analyses for my product decisions. I’ve tried using ChatGPT to try remembering SQL syntax but it’s never organized in these playground environments that I’ve seen. I’m constantly losing information, rerunning the same prompts, and can’t write notes to myself. 

This had me thinking about the many people who probably use ChatGPT to prepare for SQL interviews - I’ve seen it a lot online. If I was prepping for an interview, I would want to stay organized and also write notes to myself on important areas to focus on. Right now, the ChatGPT playground environments just wouldn’t cut it form. 

AI workbooks (free to use) could be a very good option for this. Here’s some of the benefits I see: 

1. **Structured Querying:** Unlike playground environments, workbooks are a structured environment where I can organize my queries. I can easily revise and fine-tune prompts. Also the ChatGPT cells remember context from previous cells so I don’t need to keep mentioning the dataset schema. 
2. **Annotations**: I love the idea of jotting down important insights, and tips in the workbook itself. AI Workbooks offers markdown support so I can have headings, outlines, and even attach images/GIFs. 
3. **Collaboration**: The workbook is easy to share with others - people who might have an interview coming can start with my workbook to get started and I can learn from other people’s workbooks vice-versa. 

I’m really excited about this product because it’s free for personal use and has a lot of potential to change the way we work with ChatGPT. Curious what you all think!

Will data scientist disappear? No. Will it change? I think so. Long term career considerations,155w8ss,funkyhog,1689964647.0,,False,True,Discussion,0,False,0,"Hi folks,

Background: I am a data scientist working for a mid-sized company, and just like many of you I had to really get my hands dirty and take care of also DE and MLE tasks.

I have been thinking a lot about my long-term career development and have would like to share my thoughts with you so that you can tell me where I am getting this wrong.

A few years back, the vast majority of data scientists were primarily using sk-learn to train relatively simple models (decision trees, random forests, SVMs, etc) with company-owned data. 

Over time, however, DL became increasingly popular thanks to its many breakthroughs that were obvious and visible to the masses (e.g. computer vision, language translation and now chatGPT). 

The shift towards DL has come with the price of a much increased model complexity and Research Scientist positions are now much more common also outside of FAANG.

At the same time, many pre-trained models have been open-sourced and released to the masses (e.g Hugging face), making possible things that until a few years ago, were completely out of reach for most firms. Now, with three lines of code, you can easily stack pre-trained models together that can potentially really add a ton of company value.

The large scale availability and ease of use of pre-trained models doesn't, however, automatically ease the challenge of bringing these models to production in a robust, monitored and scalable way. Needless to say, very often they directly be deployed, as transfer learning might be necessary.

&#x200B;

So my point is that in with the ""commoditisation"" of AI (powerful, pre-trained models vastly and cheaply available), we will see an increase in demand for MLEs to integrate them and Research Scientists to develop better ones. 

Data scientist positions I think will still exist, but it will be a much more business-driven position, where the role a the data scientist will be much more about thinking how to verticalize existing solutions together and adapting them to the use case, rather than really writing hands-on code and models from scratch.

&#x200B;

I, for one, would like to keep a foot on DS and another on MLE, since I also do a lot of model deployment myself (because we are a very small team). Over time, I will probably try to get better at MLE though.

"Stay in ""Startup Atmosphere"" for Experience or Job Hop?",155w3j8,thatguywiththeshoes,1689964306.0,,False,True,Career,0,False,1,"I've been working with my current team for about a year. They're a big company, but this team's whole thing is the ""startup environment"" and ""moving as fast as possible"". I know I should have seen through this at the the start, but it was an entry level job as a Data Scientist, so I needed the experience. This is my first job out of undergrad, where I got a bachelors in Computer Science. My title is Data Scientist, but I don't do much machine learning or coding. Really, I'm more of an analyst that occasionally does data engineering.

When I started, my manager (who is not technical) told us he wanted to push a machine learning model into production every two weeks. Keep in mind, almost everyone on the team is new to data science and to the company. We are using AutoML, so most of the work revolves around finding data sources, feature engineering, and promoting the models to stakeholders.  I'm not graded on the quality or quantity of the data/models that I produce, but rather on how many models I help deploy. This isn't exactly in my hands, so a lot of the work feels useless. 

Well, months went by and nothing has been deployed. Promises are always being made about cool future projects, but nothing has happened yet. In general, the atmosphere involves a lot of BS. I think most people are afraid of our manager and of telling him no, so we just continue as usual. 

Here's the issue: I'd like to start a masters in data science in Fall 2024, so I need recommendation letters and experience. I'm wondering if I should stay with the company for another year, given the economic climate and to ask my boss for a letter of recommendation. Or should I start looking for other data science jobs? My concern is that while I'm technically getting experience as a data scientist, I'm not really learning much or enjoying my work. And if I start a new job now, letters of recommendation from work experience could be difficult. The technical experience I have gained from this job isn't bad, but I feel that it's plateauing. 

Pay is decent for entry level, but certainly not competitive compared to most data scientists. Overall, I'm feeling pretty disillusioned and unsure of next steps.

How to manage large databases,155pmgh,Competitive_Speech36,1689949763.0,,False,True,Discussion,0,False,2,"As I'm building IT architecture for a startup, I've learned a lot about managing large databases. I want to share my insights and discoveries to perhaps help someone who might be facing similar challenges. In this article I reveal the critical aspects of database management and some practical tips to navigate common obstacles.

&#x200B;

# How to manage large databases

Managing databases can pose a fair share of challenges, primarily due to the size and intricacy of the data involved. Companies frequently grapple with how to effectively handle and manage the impact of data growth, especially when the database management systems struggle to keep pace.

Problems sometimes stem from disregarded issues during the initial stages of the process. This could be because the prevailing technology was presumed to inherently manage these complexities. Hence, the secret lies in having a robust plan for handling large, intricate databases, particularly when significant data growth is expected, whether predictably or otherwise.

# Data Size is Significant

The size of a database is pivotal as it impacts both performance and management approaches. The way data is processed and stored influences how the database is managed, and this holds true for data both in transit and at rest. For many large firms, data is priceless, and an increase in data could drastically alter their procedures. Therefore, planning ahead for data growth in a database is vital.

In my work with databases, I've witnessed customers struggle with performance issues and managing considerable data growth. Questions often arise, such as whether to normalize or denormalize the tables.

# The Art of Normalizing Tables

Table normalization is beneficial as it safeguards data integrity, curtails redundancy, and organizes data more efficiently for management, analysis, and extraction. However, normalized tables can come with performance penalties and potentially slow down queries due to the need for multiple joins when retrieving data.

Conversely, denormalized tables optimize retrieval primarily through indexing or using the primary key, allowing data to be stored in a buffer for faster access than performing multiple disk seeks. But they compromise data integrity and can lead to rapid database growth.

# Understanding Database Complexity

Performance penalties can often arise with large and complex databases. In these scenarios, it is often more effective to manage and process these complex calculations using backend programming languages, rather than utilizing the database directly.

# Selecting the Right Database Engine

The performance of a database server hinges on the data structure used and how it interacts with the queries made and the data retrieved from the table. The specific engine’s data structure and the queries you apply to retrieve targeted data directly impact your database server’s performance.

When dealing with a multitude of databases, using the right engine in combination with your queries and the data you need to store and retrieve can yield excellent performance. However, this necessitates a comprehensive analysis of your needs to establish the right database environment.

# Right Tools for Large Databases

Managing a large database can be challenging without a robust platform to support the process. Even with skilled database engineers, there’s always a risk of human error with the database server in use. Any misstep in altering configuration parameters or variables could lead to significant changes, potentially reducing the server’s performance.

# Some tips for working with databases:

&#x200B;

* Pick the right data types for your columns. It saves space and makes queries run faster.
* Use normalization rules to keep data tidy and avoid repeats.
* Regularly maintain your database. Think about tasks like rebuilding indexes and updating stats.
* Add indexes to columns you query a lot to speed things up, but don't go overboard.
* Write neat database queries with the right joins and filters. Keep an eye on how they perform.
* Keep a regular backup of your database for safety. Don't forget to check the backups are okay.
* Use good security to keep your database safe from unauthorized access.
* Use tools to keep tabs on how your database is performing. Spot and fix bottlenecks early.
* Build your database to grow. It'll make adding more data easier down the line.
* Keep track of your database layout, settings, and data flow. It helps when you need to solve problems.

&#x200B;

To conclude, managing large databases in 2023 necessitates not only understanding the fundamental concepts but also the use of the right tools and strategies. Through careful planning and strategic execution, you can surmount the complexities of large database management, ensuring optimal performance and robust data integrity.

False Discovery Rate correction giving contradictory results after linear regression in MATLAB,155nn5j,Brainy_Anxiety,1689945039.0,,False,True,Education,6,False,1,"&#x200B;

I am comparing three groups of people affected by dementia together (carriers of a gene related to dementia who are symptomatic, their pre-symptomatic counterparts, and non-carriers of a mutation as a control group). I want to test the impact of a mutation status (symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or non-carrier) on a signal derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging and test the interaction between mutation status and age on the outcome variable, whilst adjusting for a few variables, such as gender, handedness, and site where the scan of the subjects was performed.

To obtain my signals from functional magnetic resonance imaging that I use as outcome variables, I have coonducted an Independent Component Analysis on pre-processed brain images and have generated 24 components that correspond to brain regions where I test certain effects. I do this using a For loop in MATLAB that runs across all the 24 components and then I put all variables for the regression into a table structure that is used to run the actual regression using fitlm function in Matlab (robust regression). After I run the regression comparing the 3 groups of interest for all 24 components, I obtain results that make sense, such as for example that the symptomatic mutation carriers show a lower signal from magnetic resonance imaging, which is consistent with their age and diagnosis, etc. The way I run through all the components in the table is the following:

`load(table');`

`ic_idx = [1:size(table.components_column,2)];`

`% roi = table.components_column(:,ic_idx); % to run through all 24 components`

Then afterwards I want to correct the results using false-discovery rate correction and when I run the regression models with or without FDR correction, I get mostly identical results, which seems strange. Initially, my results were very borderline significant but in the expected direction.

1. Can this be because my results were not significant to start with for many of the comparisons, so applying the FDR correction doesn't seem to change the results much?How can it be possible to obtain very similar results with and without FDR correction? I use these lines to run the FDR correction:

`pValues = mlr.Coefficients.pValue;`

`% Apply FDR correction`

`pFDR = mafdr(pValues, 'BHFDR', true); % can also use below line`

`%fdr = mafdr(pValues, 'BHFDR', false);`

2. If I instead run the For loop only among 6 components of interest, instead of all the 24 components (i.e., brain regions of interest), I select them in the for loop like that:

`load(table');`

`ic_idx = [1:size(table.components_column,2)];`

`% roi = table.components_column(:,[4 10 17 20 21 23]); % components of interest number 4,10,17, etc.`

Then if I run the regression models using (and irrespective of correction method)

`mlr = fitlm(tbl,model,'RobustOpts',doRobust)`

my results change a lot. Now the slopes of the regression line are positive and not negative and the mutation group who is older show an increase in the signal which doesn't make any sense and contrasts a lot the results when using 24 components together, instead of a smaller number of components.

3. How can this happen statistically speaking? Am I violating an assumption of the regression model or am I being too conservative when adjusting with FDR only for 6 components and their associated comparisons?

Efficient k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Solutions with NumPy,15595e6,qtalen,1689901591.0,,False,True,Education,0,False,2," I have a friend who is a city planner. One day, he was tasked with reassessing the location suitability of thousands of gas stations in the city, needing to find the positions of the k-nearest gas stations to each one.

How can we find the nearest k stations with little time? This is a practical application scenario of the k-nearest neighbors problem.

As such, he came to me for help, hoping I could provide a high-performance solution.

So I write down this article and which will guide you on efficiently solving the [k-nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) problem using NumPy. By comparing it with a Python iterative solution, we will demonstrate the powerful performance of NumPy.

In this article, we will delve into utilizing advanced NumPy features, such as broadcasting, fancy indexing, and sorting, to implement a high-performance k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

After reading this article, you will able to:

* Understand the k-nearest neighbors problem and its practical application scenarios
* Learn how to use the NumPy library to solve the k-nearest neighbors problem
* Understand in-depth how features such as NumPy broadcasting, fancy indexing, and sorting play a role in the algorithm
* Compare the performance of NumPy with a Python iterative solution, exploring why NumPy is superior

Let’s delve into the high-performance world of NumPy together, exploring how we can solve the k-nearest neighbors problem more quickly and effectively using only NumPy.

Need career advise on what should I do next in ML :(,1550giy,Total-Opposite-8396,1689880872.0,,False,True,Career,1,False,3,"Hey everyone, hope you all are doing great. I just completed Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng and was looking for some advise on what I should do next. Would love to hear input from you guys.

I'm self studying Machine Learning full-time, while I'm also getting a bachelors degree in Computer Science from an online virtual university. It's been 3+ months since I've stepped into Machine Learning and so far I've been developing deep intuition and foundational concepts of Machine Learning . Since I'm really passionate about mathematics, I'm very much focused on understanding the mathematics behind everything.

By completing this specialization I've developed good foundational concepts of the following:

• Supervised Machine Learning  
• Linear regression  
• Logistic regression  
• Gradient Descent / Adam Optimizer  
• Neural networks  
• Bias, variance trade-offs  
• Decision trees   
• Unsupervised Learning  
• Clustering  
• Anomaly detection   
• Recommenders  
• Collaborative filtering  
• Content-based filtering  
• Reinforcement learning

In this course I got some exposure to libraries like Tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, pandas as well.

I've realized that there is so much to learn only about ML models that I can spend so much time only learning these models, but as much as I want to do that, my goal is to get a job or internship or projects that I can start earning from as soon as possible. And with that I can continue on learning and getting deeper into ML and AI. With all that I've learnt so far, Supervised / Unsupevised Learning and Neural Networks seemed to me a good path that I can take to land myself a job because of the high demand. I really wanted to dive deeper into reinforcement learning but it seems that it will make it difficult for me to land a job.

This course was very much focused on intuition building and the mathematics, but I think that now I need to develop skills and focus much on the development side of things. To get myself familiar and comfortable with the libraries and whatever that is important for development so that I can comfortably apply these models in real life.

Should I get more high-level overview of AI to understand what are other topics apart from ML that I can dive in or should I pick some topic in ML and dive deep into it. I personally am very interested to dive deeper into Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

Would love to get advise from you guys on what I should consider next or any material that you can suggest. Thankyou!",False,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1550giy/need_career_advise_on_what_should_i_do_next_in_ml/,datascience
Created a useful tool for matplotlib which automatically stores data used to make plots and auto-generates a script to recreate the plot for later fine-tuning,15507p6,BarnacleVegetable728,1689880334.0,,False,True,Tooling,2,False,3,"[https://pypi.org/project/plotagain/](https://pypi.org/project/plotagain/)

The tool provides a simple contextmanager which automatically saves data used to make matplotlib plots and automatically generates a script to reproduce the plots at a later stage.

Example usage:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from plotagain import SavePlotContext
    
    x_data = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 1000)
    y_data = np.sin(x_data)
    with SavePlotContext(""./data-save-dir"", locals(), overwrite=True) as spc:
        spc.plot(x_data, y_data, c='k', label='sin')

        spc.xlabel('xaxis')
        spc.ylabel('yaxis')
        spc.title('Title')
        spc.legend()
        spc.savefig('plot.pdf')
        spc.show()

When run, the plot is generated as though you'd used plt instead of spc. The SmartPlotContext stores all data involved, infers variable names where possible and autogenerates the below directory structure:

    data-save-dir/
      make_plot.py
      unnamed_arg.pkl
      x_data.pkl
      y_data.pkl

Where the contents of make\_plot.py is

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from plotagain import load_pickle
    
    x_data = load_pickle('x_data.pkl')
    y_data = load_pickle('y_data.pkl')
    unnamed_arg = load_pickle('unnamed_arg.pkl')
    
    plt.plot(x_data, y_data, c='k', label='sin')

If You Could Do It Over Again?,154wucf,GrapesAndApples_,1689872899.0,,False,True,Career,5,False,1,"Using a throwaway account to stay anonymous, I started with a promising data science adjacent career—a BS in math and econ from a public ivy, followed by five years in data analysis and management in finance. But then, I made a complete 180 and ventured into winemaking, where I've been for the last 15 years. In ways it can be very satisfying- to create a product from start to finish, the physicality of it, the clout. At wine dinners, I often have green-eyed professionals telling me I'm ""living the life.""

But climbing up the winemaking ladder takes ages, and it's not all smooth sailing. There's a lot of discrimination, dealing with hobbyist owners, and paper-thin profit margins. Plus, many other winemakers can be cagey so you're often teaching yourself where the results take 6-36 months to actualize. And when you make it to the top, the money stinks, the hours are brutal, and the work is stressful, not to mention physically demanding and at times, dangerous. So, I think it's time to do what many winemakers before me have done—find a better-paying job and turn the fermentation arts into a hobby.

Though I changed careers, I haven't let go of all my analyst skills. Every time I join a new winery, I set up basic spreadsheets and programs to track fermentation and elevage. Being able to compile and sift through that relatively quite modest amount of data to see trends that aren't evident at first glance is fascinating to me and dramatically preferable to shooting from the hip as the vast majority of the industry is run. Honestly, what little I have done has been the most fun part of my job, and now I want to dive back into it on a more advanced level. 

At heart I'm a pragmatist. I'm flexible on what industry I work in and the exact role I take on at the start. I'm just looking for a sound route to get back into the field that will open as many door as practical.

Is it normal to both lack documentation & have a hard time completing tasks without colleagues assistance as a new hire? Not sure if I'm simply not cut out for data analytics.,153yntq,daReallMVP,1689781595.0,,1689900717.0,True,Discussion,72,False,68,"Hi everyone.

So, it's been about six months since I began my first data analyst role at a massive FANG-esque company, and I'm feeling a bit defeated. Despite my efforts, I just missed another deadline. This happened partly because I lost a considerable amount of time waiting for clear answers or direction, and also because I made an error when pulling a join together correctly.

The problem is, I'm always on my own trying to figure things out when handling requests.  I come away from discussions with requestors not sure of what they want, and with zero documentation, an abundance of tables, nearly identical fields, and other complexities, I often give up trying to figure things out on my own and go directly to colleagues for direction.

My boss has been implying I should be more confident on my own at this point, so I can't help but wonder if he's right and I should be better at figuring things out on my own at this stage. I've also noticed a few colleagues who are also newer (although they have more background in data analysis) seem to be doing much better than me when it comes to working independently. They probably have 25% more requests completed than I do, with more made deadlines.

Typically, my workflow looks something like this:

1. Review the request.
2. Meet with the requestor to discuss further.
3. Explore the data and try to figure things out on my own.
4. When I get stuck for more than a few hours, I ask my colleagues to point me in the right direction (usually I try looking over different tables/fields, reviewing other analysts working, sitting on things to see if anything clicks).
5. I power through and continue working on it.
6. Once I believe I'm in a good place, I request peer review.
7. Finally, I work on finalizing and delivering the request.

Someone please give it to me straight. Is this my fault? Should I be doing better at this point? Should I spend some extra time after hours trying to learn our data infrastructure better?

I would greatly appreciate any advice or support you can all offer. Thank you all.  


Edit: Thank you all for the advice, encouragement, and kind words! It appears my hunch was correct; the challenges mostly stem from a dysfunctional work environment. Despite the struggles, I'll keep pushing forward and making the best of it.

Forecasting method suggestions,1546ywx,verbal_flytipper,1689800820.0,,False,True,Discussion,2,False,2,"I'm pretty new to forecasting time series and I would love some suggestions as to what methods I should be looking into for a problem I'm facing. I'm working with some data that is pretty consistently seasonal. There is a clear trend in growth but it manifests not in a uniform rise across all points, but rather in an increase amplitude of the season ""wave."" I sketched up a sine wave to illustrate what I'm dealing with (below). 

I've implemented some smoothing methods (Holt) and a couple different version of ARIMA/SARIMA models. The results are decent but the forecasts tend to lift off the from the x-axis. This has the effect of producing more accurate results for the higher value points and worse results for the lower points. I'm aware of the limitation of some methods when it comes to the stationarity of data - here the variance is clearly increasing.

I've seen people suggest just transforming the series by taking the log which will reduce the variance.

I was thinking taking a simple approach with the assumption that the growth is consistent and projecting the series into a wave with an approximately constant amplitude, forecasting in that dimension, and then transforming the forecast back into the dimension with increasing amplitude. Apologies if that explanation makes no sense.

I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for models or transformations I should be looking into? If any packages are particularly well suited I'm working in Python.

Improving time series prediction model,154at4u,CreepyParsnip342,1689810179.0,,False,True,Discussion,0,False,1,"Hey guys, I am lost and looking for ideas, not a pro or native speaker, so bare with me with the language please.

So I made from scratch this time-series prediction method, which has an accuracy of n% for binary predictions. The prediction is simply for the value of the time-series to go up or down. The n% seems to be within a certain range (+-5% units) for all prediction timepoints in future that I have tested so far.

The % is promising but not super high, I don’t think I can improve the % itself, but I would need an idea how to improve the situation, in a way how to “align the stars”, so that I would know when my predictions are at their most accurate and when at their worst, so that I could opt to use them or not.

I tried already to find correlations with single and multi variable methods from additional data I pulled from my own method (not from the time-series data), but in majority of cases they did not provide me with any higher probability than the initial one. Intuitively I think it could be that I should not focus on what makes it work but what doesn’t, if that makes any sense?

If anyone has any ideas how to find “patterns” or clues what could cause such method to work or not and when, I would be really happy to hear them. I am sure this is not so so unusual situation, but I feel stuck, and I know I am far out of my comfort zone here.

Handling Imbalanced Data,153year,fartbombin321,1689780998.0,,False,True,Discussion,4,False,5,"I want to preface this post by acknowledging that these questions may have been asked before here. But I would appreciate your answers to my specific questions.

I have had these questions for a long time, and after reading about several approaches, I am still unsure about when to use which approach while dealing with imbalanced data. I have the following questions:

1.  According to my understanding, if the minority class is about 10% or lower compared to the total data, one should consider applying imbalanced data handling techniques. Is my understanding correct?
2. Most scikit-learn models have the \`balanced\` parameter, which can be set to true to add more weight to the minority class observations. Will this on its own be enough to handle the imbalance?
3. I have also come across undersampling/oversampling. Wouldn't performing either of the two alter the inherent nature of the data?

As for how I approached this problem in one of my projects, I created a custom function that checked multiple classification thresholds on each model I built to determine the (optimal) threshold by maximizing the F1 score. Compared with the baseline model (without changing the classification threshold) results, the results for the optimal threshold were better in accurately classifying the minority class. Is my approach appropriate in this situation?

Quick background: I graduated with a BA in Geography in 2015, then got lucky enough to transition into data science via a bootcamp in 2018.

Ideally I would like to stay in a role balanced between data/software and energy.

One of my colleagues suggested that we can just do plots that have a bunch of boxplots for each quartile of a target metric. I am not convinced that this is rigorous enough and can actually work.  


My ideas was to have a causal approach. That means finding a causal relationship between the target metrics and other operational metrics.

Good Day to all!   


I am not sure if this is the proper venue to be posting this. 

I am from the Philippines and currently working as a reporting specialist for a private BPO Company managing large dataset with I could say intermediate skills in terms of Excel and PowerBI purely revolving around PowerQuery.

I know I do the work similar to a data analyst but I do not know how to move forward with upskilling. Putting up this post just in case some of you guys would want to take me as an apprentice for more exposure. I am willing to do it for free in return of the experience, learning and guidance I will receive.

For full disclosure. I do have a full time work from home job in the evening. Please DM me or comment on this post if you are interested on taking on a very low risk time investment on me.

I look forward to venture on full career shift once I receive an approval with your expertise. TIA",False,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/152zsz6/finding_study_partner_or_mentor/,datascience

Company Introducing - and Implying a Switch to - Microsoft Fabric,152cue3,GoingDownTheLine,1689625319.0,,False,True,Discussion,1,False,2,"Hi r/datascience,

My company recently sent out a notice that it is bringing on a new tool called Microsoft Fabric, claiming that it has been specifically designed for automation processes and Data Science machine learning tasks. I had never heard of this, and tried to look into it, but honestly could not find much in the way of videos, demos, guides, etc. Besides a handful of Youtube videos and Microsoft's own info on the product, there doesn't seem to be much of anything out there.

From what I can gather, it seems like this product is maybe only 2-3 months old and is now available for purchase. In one of the videos I saw with the product being used for about a minute, it seemed very basic and limited in its functions.

My current role has me doing less coding in favor of using Alteryx, and I've been able to get a ton of processes automated and turned around in no time. Alteryx even has integration with Python for more in-depth analysis. My company seems to be heavily implying that we will do away with Alteryx (it is fairly expensive, I'll give them that) to use Fabric instead, but from what I've seen about the product I don't see how that's feasible.

I was curious if anyone on here has heard of Microsoft Fabric, or had similar experiences with their company trying to use Fabric as a replacement for automation processes? I don't really see any benefit with using Fabric besides cutting costs on what looks like a very barebones, unfinished product.

Thanks!

Rant - I feel like the nature of DS work is becoming less and less creative.,151r5sx,puppy_nap,1689566904.0,,False,True,Discussion,25,False,36,"Some backgroud - I've been working for ~15 years in various modeling related roles (statistical programmer/research scientist/xyz analyst/DS). Lately I feel increasingly disheartened about the type of work I'm asked to do, as well as the quality of work in data science generally. 

When I first started, to build a good model, whether predictive or inferential, I'd do research into the domain, come up with my own mental models and hypotheses of what actually shapes the behavior of your dependent variable, then knit together different quantitative methods to formalize the knowledge into a testable model. I had a lot of freedom over the ""backend"", and could build a custom tech stack and data pipeline tailored for the specific needs of the project.

Nowadays, with the dominance of GBDT and DL for predictive modeling, nothing really matters except scale, resources, and computing power. Optimization and compatability are all important so everyone ends up using the same models, the same tech, the same ""mlops"" frameworks. My previous job was working on an ASR model for a voice assistant at a big tech, which sounds cool to a lot of people, but in reality the actual work consisted of editing config files and making minor optimizations to different parameters. The only work that ever required brainpower was engineering work, not modeling work. I work at a much smaller company now but still, everything is about prebuilt tools and prebuilt models and prebuilt architectures.

Inferential analytics can still be fun, but it's increasingly rare with more business activity shifting online and thus A/B tests increasingly common. Plus, the quality/time bar on these projects keeps dropping - frankly because many new DS hires have limited knowledge/care about anything that's not ML, and will churn out very low quality output for analytics work. And increasingly I see people pumping out fishy analytics models just to get results that align with management/executive expectations.

How do I negotiate a better salary in a DA position?,152aw2n,_unbanned_datum,1689620907.0,,1689621130.0,True,Career,7,False,2,"Hello,

Title says most of it, I’m a Data Analyst but working directly under the C-Suit and being the companies only data analyst I end up doing so much more. 

I regularly work with APIs from Google Ads, Facebook Ads, GA4, etc. to enrich our data for custom reports. Many times, I am designing databases (typically Postgres but some old ones are on SQLite3) to store this data and power reporting infrastructure that I built. I taught myself Prefect for this job, and I build reporting automations with it as well.

Many times I am communicating directly with our database leads, server leads, Android leads, iOS leads, web leads, and various project managers to orchestrate a plan which I’d formulated to meet some reporting requirement. 

For one example, advising our Android team to send app-instance referrer data to our database upon successful registration. Then I had our database team make adjustments to store this information alongside other user registration data. Then I would go into Google Ads and configure our ads to correctly insert this data in the right spots of our ads. Then I configured an automation to automatically generate reports and distribute them at specific times. So I’m managing this entire pipeline, for one example, that includes every single one of our company ads, all of our client apps, unique customer attribution methodologies for each client, standardization on the server side, storage and automated reporting.

Quite often, when there’s a reporting need, they task me with it and it’s my job to make data sense from their business requirements. Then that’s plan it all out and orchestrate it. I also lead a meeting dedicated to showcasing our stakeholders company progress since last meeting. 

All of this, and I was hired at $56,000 approximately one year ago. This was my first job in this career first, and probably my 50th interview, so I saw it as a great opportunity despite the lower pay and took it.

Now, I think it’s appropriate to negotiate a higher pay. The problem though, first, is that I do not really know what I am here and therefore what my expectations should be. I feel like a data analyst engineer perhaps, but I’m not sure of that. I do not, however, think it is still appropriate to base my salary solely on that of my areas Data Analysts.  
Second issue is that I’m not sure how to negotiate well. Should it be in person, and how should I initiate this?

I would like to deepen my knowledge in basic statistics, and then regression, time-series, and  machine learning models, preferably on R but Python is also possible. Can anyone please recommend me books and/or online courses that would help me in this?

Am I underpaid or is it ok?,151fhor,Ok-Ad-561,1689536613.0,,False,True,Career,59,False,75,"Hi, I’ve been recently wondering if I’m getting underpaid at my job or if my salary is ok.

I work as a Data Scientist at a small company in western Massachusetts, near Springfield MA. I started working here after graduating college May of 2022- my degree was in Math and Philosophy. When I started work in October 2022, I was only guaranteed 3 months at the job. I was being paid 15$ an hour for the first month (this was like a onboarding period). Then once I settled, it got increased to 18$ per hour. After the 3 months, I got a further salary bump to 24$ an hour. 

This April (6 months into the job), I negotiated my salary for a raise for the first time. Being my first ever salary negotiation, I feel like I kinda undersold myself. There was a bit of a confusion on the final agreement, but basically my salary was increased to 70k per year (33.65$ an hour).

Overall, I think this is a good salary. Especially when I look at where I was compared to where I am now, and the cost of living in this areas, there’s a lot to be thankful for. As a international student I got really lucky to find a job in the nick of time. But, I’ve done a lot of good work here - in fact I do more Data engineering and software engineering than data science, and I do everything from controls engineering to database management to software development to Statistical analysis. When I look at the pay for data scientists in the market, idk if I’m being underpaid.

My work involves handling lots of data, drafting academic papers (as part of a team) and creating dashboards/visualizations. Lots of descriptive stats stuff, but some projects involve more inferential stuff. But since my formal academic background itself isn't data-centric, I need your insights on gaining demonstrable and competitive data skills.

I think there are lots of skills I can develop at the think tank, and they are very open to letting me work on whatever projects I want - improving data management, enhancing leadership skills with interns, academic pubs, learning new tools like SAS (widely used in my organization), GIS, or even pursuing a funded MA in applied economics or statistics. I can't seem to pinpoint the most impactful path.

Network analysis tips for my project?,151oc4z,AdFew4357,1689558641.0,,1689559208.0,True,Projects,1,False,2,"For my project, I ended up transforming my dataset into such a way that I have now computed a 224x224 distance matrix. The distance matrix represents chunks or “subsequences” of a time series, and the objective is to understand how different parts of the multivariate time series are related to each other. This similarity matrix aims to show, what aspects of the multivariate time series are related through one another. Each row represent a 10 second chunk of a time series, and the columns are other chunks, and how similar the given row is to the other chunks. 

I have done dimension reduction and found 98% of the variance being captured in the first PC. Observing and clustering this in PC space, gives not very many insights. There doesn’t seem to be any true clusters.

I fit a linear model regressed on the first principal component and it does very well, but I’m not quite satisfied.

I also did hierarchical clustering. This was pretty good, but I need to make the graphs look better because it’s hard to visualize the dendrogram.


I’ve decided to take a different approach, and try to exploit the distance matrix in a different way, and I realized that due to it being a square matrix I can visualize it in a graph. 

This led me down the path of network analysis. Each node represents a chunk of one of the 5 univariate time series, and the edges correspond to the similarities between other chunks/subsequences. 

I have built a graph/network visualization with this, but now I run into a few issues:

1) what can I do further with this network? I want to do some network analysis, but I haven’t really done graph data analysis before. Any resources for this would be great, or future directions

2) I was going to fit the lasso, in order to invoke sparsity in the matrix. Then from there either fit a model on these remaining features, or cluster again.

Variance in series of series.,151ghsk,Sea_Put_2759,1689538948.0,,False,True,Discussion,4,False,2,"Hello all

I was studying some ways to follow a tendency of a list of values, and I thought to use a variance approach. The way I was thinking to use is to apply a simple variance in chunks of the values and then walk one position in serie and save de value. Then apply over again in new chunk until the end of list. In the end I plot the chart and can follow the tendency. 

Example:

data = \[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2\]

Apply the variance formula to first 3 values, \[1, 2, 3\], that is 1. Then to next three, from the second item, \[2, 3, 4\], that is 1 too. And so on until the end of the list. In the example before, I will have the following result list.

\[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.333333333333333, 2.3333333333333335, 1.3333333333333335, 1.0, 2.333333333333333, 1.0, 0.33333333333333337\]

For the first three values I assume that is 0, because I don't have the reference before this.

Is this a valid approach to validate a tendency? This was very aleatory values and just for example.

Mr. Unemployable or: How I graduated with a master's in DS and ended up becoming a full time DoorDash driver,14zxs2w,ricedealer97,1689383087.0,,False,True,Career,209,False,409,"Our tale begins in the balmy summer of 2017. A fresh high school graduate, ripe with youthful aspiration and dreams larger than his rural countryside small-town life, embarks on a journey into the thrilling world of data science. He finds himself drawn towards the promise of the burgeoning fields of 'big data', 'artificial intelligence', and 'machine learning'. A fruitful and wondrous exit from his quaint high school and an invitation into an elite T20 university's engineering program fuel his starry-eyed anticipation.

""This is it!"" he proudly exclaimed, clutching his admission letter like a golden ticket. ""I'm going to be at the forefront of technological advancement!"" 

But the hallowed halls of the elite university, notorious for their impossibly high standards of academic performance, shattered his preconceptions of an 'effortless college life'. The scholarly demands of his STEM professors required a high degree of analytical intelligence, as vast and deep as an ocean, and made his high school coursework seem like a shallow puddle in comparison.

His junior year was inevitably marred by a subpar GPA and triggered a bone-chilling thought: perhaps he had chosen the wrong field. But even the slightest consideration of such a blasphemous idea threatened to unleash a nightmarish beast of fury from his Asian parents, whose dreams and financial support were deeply intertwined with his academic successes in STEM. Unyielding to the symptoms of imposter syndrome, he chose to press onward; yet the repercussions of his scholarly performance turned the uphill battle of securing an internship into a seemingly hopeless war of attrition.

*Audentes Fortuna Iuvat*, he thought to himself as he struggled forward. ""Fortune favours the bold."" And in the midst of his struggles, fortune did indeed toss him a coin, for an offer to participate in a paid research position within the university's engineering college presented itself to him. A glimmer of hope. And although the mindless data wrangling and programming tasks associated with the position weren't quite compelling to him, his supervisor nevertheless sung praises of his 'outstanding achievements'.

“You’re performing admirably, and your work impresses me,” his supervisor lauded. “Your data analysis and visualization skills are commendable, and your automation tools have significantly aided our statisticians. Would you consider continuing your studies with us as a graduate research assistant?”

Within the seemingly endless cavern of hopeless despair, he had crawled upon his hands and knees for what seemed like an eternity, searching for even the faintest light. And just like that, a luminous supernova had engulfed the never-ending chasm in a sea of white. A new hope. And upon entry into this new world of graduate studies, he found immediate success.

His research responsibilities blossomed under his supervisor's guidance, and his work evolved into first-authorship of papers in esteemed academic journals and presentations at conferences worldwide. A newfound burning passion for data science in the realm of academia had inspired him to work on personal projects that applied ML models to fields as diverse as virtual reality, semantic code search, and agent-based modeling (one of these had ended up becoming his master's thesis!).

Beaming with pride over his achievements, he applied to an array of data scientist positions during his final semester in 2023 with fervor. His resume, carefully sculpted after countless revisions, was given a seal of approval by his colleagues in the industry as well as career service professionals.

""Your resume is crazy bro!"" his peers cheered of his listed successes, ""You are literally guaranteed a job with this one.""

But alas, despite carefully tailoring his resume keywords and applications, rejection after rejection befell our hopeful fresh master's grad, and the tendrils of imposter syndrome had once again begun to weave itself thoroughly into the deep, dark trenches of his somber mind. Despite pivoting to seemingly more attainable 'data analyst' positions, come graduation, his job offers remained as empty as the infinite void of interstellar space, a vast expanse untouched by the glimmer of distant stars. Confronted with his apartment's soaring rent hikes and sudden severance of his parents' financial support due to his failure to secure a job, he found himself scrambling to get approved as a DoorDash delivery driver to keep himself afloat until his lease's expiry in August.

We now fast forward to present day, 234 applications later, he remains without a single callback. Our once hopeful protagonist now spends his days behind the wheel, endlessly driving, chasing futile dreams. His enthusiasm wanes with every subsequent rejection and repeated echoes of ""we've decided to pursue another candidate.""

What future awaits him? Will he secure his dream data science position before his lease ends in August? Or will he sorrowfully return to his parent's home and continue to do deliveries full time?

Find out next time in chapter 2 of ""Mr. Unemployable or: How I graduated with a master's in DS and ended up becoming a full time DoorDash driver""!

How I transitioned from Accounting / Finance to Data Analytics after 7 years of work.,1509qjo,Casio04,1689420916.0,,False,True,Career,2,False,16,"**Introduction**

Hey everyone, I don't know how long this post will be but for sure I know it will be a long one.   
I just want to say that, as many of you around this sub, I am also looking for personal growth and wondering stuff (currently it is ""should I transition to Data Science? If so, how?"") and while reading the FAQ's and weekly threads, I noticed there is not a lot of posts related to non-STEM background transitioning to Data Analysis, hence this is my attempt to help anyone out there.

**Background / Context**

I studied my undergrad degree in Mexico City (my hometown) in Finance and Banking. It was mostly focused in trading (debt and equity) and corporate finance (budgetting, ledgers, basics of forecasting, entrepreneurship). Since year 1, I also worked as an intern for a private bank, so I always had my days pretty packed with homehork, classes and things to do at work. 

After graduation, I was still in the same company but now with a full-time job as a financial ""analyst"" , where my analysis weren't further than creating Excel Sheets with some graphs, until I eventually got involved into learning VBA and programming macros, and this is where I found out I loved stuff related to coding. 

Up to this point I was still working in the company but now helping all the teams to automate all of their processes through VBA and even some Python (I used to search on my own all of this, mostly on YouTube or StackOverflow). I still didn't have any idea on what actual data analysis was, I was just enjoying the process of learning new skills. 

**The transition to Data Analysis**

After approximately 1.5 years of doing VBA and automation, I felt stuck and not learning anyomre. The company I worked for is very small, around 100 employes, so there was no clear organizational structure to grow, I had no mentors or anything like it. 

Here is where I found this [Data Analytics BootCamp](https://bootcamp.tec.mx/data/) in one of the best private universities in the country. I managed some stuff at work and convinced my boss to pay for the whole thing, as the BootCamp itself was a bit expensive (around 6k USD) and I couldn't afford it myself out of the blue. 

I am no related to the school at all other than being their former student on this Bootcamp, so everything I am going to say is pure personal experience, but you can also check [what other people say about it](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tecnologico-de-monterrey-boot-camps).

The program was very intense, it lasted for 9 months and I had at least 6 hours of studying per week (after working hours). The program is fast-paced, and is made for you to actually study most of the time rather than just keeping what you saw in class. The teacher shows you the basics, answers questions and shows a couple of examples, but gives a lot of resources where you can expand your knowledge based on the topics you saw. 

After finishing, I couldn't believe that I was able to set up a basic HTML webpage online, containing Python code in the backend that would execute some analysis after clicking a button on the frontend. This was our final project (unfortunately Heroku changed its pricing plan so the page is no longer up, otherwise I would share it), and I was so proud of how much I learned using Python, SQL, HTML and JavaScript (and a few libraries from it). 

After finishing, you also get career coaching to improve your CV and LinkedIn profile to adapt to today's recruitment world, which oh boy, only if I knew. I learned about the automated systems that review CV's, what kind of elements you should include and exclude from a CV, what experience is actually relevant, what should you add as skills or activities in your previous jobs, and much more. 

And finally after 3 months of finishing the bootcamp, I was landing my first job as a Data Analyst in [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/en/). As a small reminder from the title, **this happened after 7 full years of working experience.**

**What happened after becoming a Data Analyst**

I was super happy with my new job, everything was new for me, I was learning tons and already delivering good results after 3-4 months of being at my new job. Little that I knew, I was sourced on LinkedIn from a recruiter in the other side of the world and being offered full relocation package to work for Bolt, the so-called ""Uber EU competitor"". One of my life goals was to live abroad, so after a long 5 months of process, I was ready to relocate to Estonia. 

Now, after 1.5 years, I have been promoted to Senior Data Analyst and I'm still learning and enjoy as much as when I first did data analysis. Of course, we all want to keep growing and improving, so I just keep doing so and from time to time trying to get more involved into Data Science, so hopefully one day I can make another post of ""non-STEM background transitioned to Data Science"". 

**What skills do I actually use as a Data Analyst?** 

I think most of us are stuck in a never-ending world filled with as many resources as possible and we are often told ""you need to learn X, Y and Z skills"" while others say ""you actually need A, B and C"". While there is no aboslute truth, I will tell you what skills I use everyday since I started this journey:

\- Logical thinking. This is perhaps one of the most underrated skills, as I don't see many people talking about it. The fact that you need to understand how coding works in a logical level it's so crucial but everyone gives it for granted. You should be able to know what are logical operators, what is a function and its parameters and how do they work, what is the logic behind a LOOP, an IF and how to gather everything together. This goes beyond any programming language, you can always ask ChatGPT nowadays how to write an IF statement in JS, Python, R, SQL, etc. But **when** and **how** to apply  it is the most important part. 

\- SQL. This is by far top 1 language I needed to learn. Even before Python (which comes next), SQL is a very basic tool everyone aspiring to be a Data Analyst should have. Even if you don't know Python, you can even read tables using SQL through Python, and not the other way around. You should know how to select columns, transform them, create new ones, group them, do Window functions, Ranking functions, and more. 

\- Python. I don't know how many companies out there don't use Python, but I would say it's a pretty standard language to learn nowadays, specially because its structure is not so complicated to learn. I've seen already a good description on the basic libraries you should know about Python [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/wiki/frequently-asked-questions/#wiki_how_do_i_learn%2E%2E%2E), so I won't repeat much about it. 

\- Statistics. If you want to analyze data, you need to know at least basic statistics to help you through the day. You should be able to know basic concepts such as trends, medians, means, basic regression, interquartiles, discrete variables, and so on. I am maybe not the best guide in this field as I have not that much knowledge on it and what I know is more from my previous experience rather than formal education, so maybe I'm saying some stuff that it's not basic.   
The whole point is that you should be able somehow to identify the trends and spot problems, opportunities within the data you analyze. Most of the times the managers and other higher management won't care if you did a super exotic model or a very basic comparison, they care for the value you can bring. 

\- BI Tool. I personally use Looker, but it really doesn't matter if you use Power BI, Tableau or I don't know which others exist out there. The full point is to understand how BI tools work, what are dimensions and measures and which ones are grouped by to get proper results. You should know also what is the purpose of each graph and adapt it accordingly to your needs.

\- Communication skills. This is also taken for granted in many cases but I have first-hand seen a lot of people that can't communicate their ideas clearly. They are great at finding insights or coding, but they can't just translate their technical thoughts to good business opportunities, thus upper management folks just disregard ideas or don't understand clearly and don't push their ideas to a proper place. 

I think these are the top 5 skills I can tell you are constantly used in my every day life. Some others that I also use constantly but were not the basis for getting a job here are: 

\-Github or any other version control software (I would say this is a VERY important tool to have and every tech-related person should know it, but it was not relevant in any of my interview process so not highlighting it)   
\- dbt  
\- Databricks (SparkSQL)  
\- Relational vs no Relational Databases  
\- Jupyter Notebooks (Mostly related to Python learning, so kinda assumed you know how to use them after learning Python)  


**Summary / Conclusions**

If you feel more confused than you were after reading all of this (thank you for reading btw), I will try to summarise the most important points: 

1. If you don't have any good background in math or statistcs nor programming, I would encourage you to at least study some kind of bootcamp or specialization in Data Analysis, where Python, SQL, Statistics and a Power BI tool are taught. If you are a self-learner that is also a good way, however, unfortunately some companies prefer solid studies backgrounds (which I don't agree with), so we also need to think how the real world is moving. 
2. This is a long path. You don't have to work 7 years like I did to start thinking about studying something, as everyone's path is different. But those years definitely helped me to develop some skills such as knowing your stakeholders, communicating clrearly and logical thinking. So I can tell you that it's highly likely you won't transition in one or 2 years, specially if you have no prior experience. Remember it's not a race, it's your professional path and what you will be doing for the rest of your life (if that's what you want of course), so better to take the needed steps to do it right and in the long term you will find better benefits. 
3. One thing I didn't mention in the Bootcamp part is that you should aim to have a Github portfolio showcasing some of your projects. There are many resources like [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) that can help you work in projects and upload them to Github. These projects will help you not only to practice your skills and take them to then next level, but will also be a complimentary tool in your job-search. 

Finally, if you have any questions or feel like I could improve the information in my post, let me know and I'll try my best to answer or update this.

About half way through my undergraduate degree in Finance (2017), I had to take a course called Management Information Systems. The professor had worked in Data Science and often told us about his experience. He always brought real world examples into his teaching. Not long after, I quickly double majored in Data Analytics. My school had a great program in the field and was one of the first to offer it as a major. In fact, just a year ago, they created a state-of-the-art analytics lab to complement our Bloomberg lab (with real Bloomberg terminals). I learned a ton, and I was entrenched in the field fully. 

Although I didn’t have a CS background, I had a ton of knowledge in stats, so I immediately enjoyed the classes that got into ML models. Furthermore, I learned a ton about data architecture and it’s been very useful in my professional career thus far. 

I graduated in 2020 and was ready to get into the industry. Not long after, COVID started and job prospects went out the window. It took several months, but in September of 2020 I landed my first job after graduating as a Technical Operations Analyst. It wasn’t exactly what I wanted, but work was hard to come by. I had to take a few Operations Research courses in my undergrad, so I had a decent foundation. The role didn’t involve much, but I did implement an ERP system for the company. In January of 2021 (ironically on my birthday), the company went out of business and unfortunately I was searching for work once again. 

I sent out hundreds of applications, and ended up landing my current job as a “Data Migration Analyst”. I essentially manage databases, write custom queries and work with Azure. Unfortunately, there’s no analytics involved, but it pays well and I enjoy it. However, I never lost my desire to get into the Data Science field.

I have a lot of downtime with my job, so I decided to start my Master of Science in Data Science. It’s been great thus far, and I’ll be graduating this fall. 

Although it’s not complete yet, I’ve been applying to jobs in the field. Whether it’s data engineer/scientist/analyst, BI analyst/developer etc, I’m getting almost no traction. I’ve applied to 100+ jobs. 

I have a portfolio with 3 projects:

1. Used Python to clean/manipulate NFL data and create an interactive dashboard that assigns a rookie prospect grade based on college performance & combine athletic metrics. 

2. Performed a clustering analysis using R on credit card data. I then analyzed a specific cluster that displayed poor credit behaviours using excel. 

3. Created a visually-appealing Power BI dashboard for US Super Market sales. The first dashboard displays all of the relevant metrics, the second forecasts sales for X amount of days in advance. I also used DAX/power query. 


The only traction I’ve gotten since December:

- had interviews in the winter for a Jr. Cloud Engineering role but unfortunately fell short after 4 rounds of interviews.  
- had a headhunter reach out for a contract Data Analyst role, but I said I needed 2 weeks notice and they needed an immediate start
- had an offer for a Middle Database Developer role, but the money was horrendous, so I just couldn’t justify the pay cut 

I know the market is bad, but is there something I’m doing wrong or could change here? I think my resume is perfected, everything down to metrics of improvement are on there. For example, I contributed to a 300% increase in firms onboarded per-month at my current role. 

What would you do differently? It’s hard being 26 years old and feeling like the chances of getting into the industry are fading with every day I don’t apply everything I’ve learned in a work setting.

Differences between Feature Store and Data Catalog in Databricks,1506eua,north_pr,1689409996.0,,False,True,Discussion,1,False,2,"Hi everyone,

Our small team has just finished the data preparation phase of our project and started data analysis in Databricks. As we go deeper into this field, we're trying to understand the distinctions and appropriate uses for a Feature Store versus a Data Catalog. On the surface, it seems to me that both are ways to manage and use tables of data.

For example, let's consider a churn prediction. We need to create a table (or several) for churn prediction and join later, which would include multiple features that could potentially influence a user's possibility to churn. It appears to me that we could just create a new table in a Data Catalog with this information. However, I am not sure if this is the right approach or if a Feature Store could be more suitable.

Here are my questions

1. In what situations would we prefer to use a Feature Store over a Data Catalog, or vice versa?
2. In the context of our Churn Prediction example, would it be more beneficial to use a Feature Store? If so, why?
3. If we were to use a Feature Store in this scenario, what would that look like in terms of setup and workflow?

Really appreciate every help, ideally, any examples would be great. I'm very noob using Databricks, and a real-world approach would be very very helpful.

Hello people, I come from the data area. I've worked as a Back-end at the start of my career, then I moved on to Data Engineer and later to Machine Learning Engineer.

But I find this area tough. It's a lot of mathematics, statistics. And every week there's a Chinese or Indian with a new paper. And then you have to study the paper etc.

Besides, I have ADHD. The medication helps a lot. But ADHD also causes other social interaction problems. Which in data science you need a lot. You need to explain the predictions well to assist in decision-making. So it's really hard to me to intensively study all the time. It's really cool to create model, but it's also very stressful as you need to study more and more. 

Also, it's I think I always think that I'm not enough to be a very good data scientist. The data science knowledge is infinite.

Moreover, most companies are not data-driven. And they hardly know what machine learning actually is.

I have knowledge mainly in Python, general software engineering stuff, API, Kubernetes, Docker etc.

And at the end of the day, you work/study yourself to death and earn the same as in other areas.

I'm at a mid-level today. I don't know if I have a wrong impression. But those I know who left DS did so for the reasons I mentioned.

And I'm thinking of becoming a Python developer with Django. Since I have more knowledge in Python. I've also played around with Node and have some experience in Scala.

Thank you in advance for your help. I am analyzing some behavioral data, where a subject can be in one of 4 locations.

My first thought was to simply create a score based on ""time in location 1"" - ""time in location 4"". Yet, the subjects can spend varying amounts of time in 1 of the other two locations. Would this suggest some form of normalization or standardization might be beneficial?

However, when we invited them onsite and asked them the same questions, their response was vastly different and incorrect. What's sad is most of the cheaters that our recruiters vetted were ironically coming from top nearby firms (MANGA), and I cannot believe how they managed to work at those firms if they cannot answer data related questions.

I'm working on my MS in Data Science right now and we had a lecture on clustering yesterday. I really enjoyed it and saw the applications of it, so I wanted to do a personal project to throw on my resume.

My idea is to use that data and make a dashboard that allows the user to filter by cluster. Evidently, the dashboard needs categorical data to gain valuable insight from the clusters.

Basic Forecasting - trend vs seasonality,14xxs56,Mission-Wall-3311,1689189281.0,,False,True,Discussion,1,False,1,"I'm interested in learning a bit more about formal data science methods. Curious about the proper way to approach forecasting (let's say, incoming work orders).

I built a super simple model to just brainstorm a starting point. I basically used the model to produce ""data"" and am trying to use that data to reverse engineer the model.

Weeks 1-12 are 1000 work orders a week, weeks 17-36 are 2000, and weeks 41-52 are 1000 (ignoring potential week 53 for simplicity). From 12-17 orders ramp up at 200/week and 36-41 ramp down by 200/week. That's the seasonality I built.

I then built 130 weeks (2.5 years) of ""data"" by taking the first week = 1000, and every week I looked up the seasonal value, compounded by 1.0009 per week from the starting point (5% annual growth). That's my data set I'm trying to reverse engineer the model from.

The new data scientist who started with my company is teaching me python and we built a model together, that basically took a linear trend, and then calculated seasonality based on the deviation from the linear trend.

The problem is, the trend in the beginning model doesn't change, it's a 1.05\^(1/52) weekly compound growth. However, the trend in the output model changes dramatically based on how many weeks are in the dataset. If it's a multiple of 52, it's fine, but at 64 weeks for instance it underestimates the trend (extra data at low seasonality) and at 88 weeks it overestimates the trend (extra data at high seasonal points).

I'm not even sure a linear trend is appropriate given the expected compounding growth.

The next generation of AI platforms,14xwbrz,Competitive_Speech36,1689185967.0,,False,True,Discussion,0,False,0,"I've been hired lead building IT architecture for a startup from scratch - something I am doing for the first time - and I have discovered a lot of new insights along the way. I want to share them with you too and discuss MLOps and no-code AIs:

# The next generation of AI platforms

In the age of data, businesses are always looking for ways to use their information. One method is through machine learning. However, managing these machine learning operations (MLOps) often brings its own set of challenges. Here's where no-code AI can help.

No-code AI platforms are user-friendly tools that allow us to create AI solutions without advanced coding skills. With these platforms, businesses can streamline MLOps and make the most of their intelligent systems.

# Challenges in MLOps

Managing machine learning involves a lot of steps. This process starts with preparing and annotating data, then developing a model and evaluating its performance. After that, we have to integrate the model into the organization's systems, update it regularly, and monitor it to maintain effectiveness.

Here are three major challenges in this process:

**Communication gaps:** Often, AI experts and domain experts work in silos, leading to miscommunication due to their differing knowledge and objectives. To successfully develop AI and machine learning systems, these experts need to work together.

**Quick iterations:** In the real world, problems and solutions change quickly. Academic software packages and datasets, where machine learning came from, often struggle to keep up. Real-world settings are far messier than controlled lab environments, requiring models to be extensively tested in operational environments.

**Infrastructure management:** As organizations build and deploy more machine learning systems, they need robust infrastructures to handle these processes. The infrastructure needs to support data manipulation, model creation, deployment, and the training of new models.

# The Solution: No-Code AI

Recently, 'lightweight' AI platforms have become more popular. These platforms allow non-experts to train machine learning models, and are also known as AI as a Service. Examples of these platforms include BigML, Google AutoML, Microsoft Azure ML, Clarifai, and Levity.

These platforms are user-friendly and offer low-cost solutions, potentially making AI adoption more widespread.

# How No-Code AI Can Help with MLOps

No-code AI platforms can help address the key challenges in MLOps. They can bridge the gap between business and IT experts, speed up the production of AI models, and reduce the infrastructural demands of complex operations.

Here's how:

**Bridging the gap:** The inclusive nature of no-code AI platforms allows a broader range of individuals to contribute to machine learning workflows. This approach encourages cross-skilling, reduces reliance on a few key individuals, and bridges the gap between domain experts and data scientists.

**Speeding up production:** By helping with rapid prototyping and deployment, no-code AI accelerates the time it takes to get a product to market. This democratisation of machine learning technology helps organizations quickly develop and roll out AI solutions, bridges the expertise gap, and allows AI experts to focus on core tasks.

**Reducing infrastructural demands:** No-code AI also allows organizations to focus on their primary operations by outsourcing infrastructure maintenance tasks to service providers. This reduces the need for troubleshooting and setup, and management of software and hardware infrastructure.

# Conclusion

No-code AI platforms have the potential to make AI more accessible to a larger demographic, regardless of their technical skills. This can lead to more effective AI deployment and decision-making processes. Organizations can also save resources, which can then be allocated to other areas of business.

Currently working at a sales driven business which is quite new to data. From what I have been currently told and presented their sales pipeline is non linear and quite different from anything I can find on the Internet.

What approach did you guys take to fully understand each stage, how it all works so you can best identify the gaps that can be improved with data projects?

My current ideas are to set up meetings with some of the sales people to discuss this also shadow them to see what they do in each stage and attend some of their planning meetings to understand their focus.

Data Science in Popular Culture,14wvjqu,KarmaIssues,1689091763.0,,False,True,Discussion,1,False,1,"So I was watching a series on Netflix called The Good Place and it occurred to me that the show actually produced a pretty great analogy for the principal of concept drift. 

So in the show, human beings get rated on their lives in order to decide whether they get put into the Good Place (goods) or the Bad Place (bads). 

All actions are fundamentally rated on wether they are good or bad and then combined into a final score, if they meet the threshold then they go to the good place otherwise straight to Hell.

Well this model performs really well (I assume, their's no robust model monitoring process so who knows), up until a few centuries ago and since then every human has been sent to the Bad Place. 

How? The model was performing perfectly for 200,000 years! Why has it suddenly broken? Well what they eventually found out was that since the world has gotten more complex (more globalised,  we're all richer etc), almost all actions get labelled as bad. You save a child, you contribute to global warming dumb dumb. You don't save a child,  you've caused their parents immense suffering, you heartless bastard. 

So what happened well in technical terms the statistical properties of the target variable change over time. Good actions were no longer getting characterised as good because no one accounted for the target variables changing. A good model monitoring process could've caught this.

Creating ensemble model using base model input features,14wtb2s,atomTA,1689086591.0,,False,True,Projects,0,False,2,"Hi all, 

Apologies if this is a basic question. I've been working on a classification problem for the last few months, primarily landing on using a random forest classifier as the model used, and I've spent the last couple of months working on feature engineering, feature selection, hyperparameter optimisation etc to improve my model up to 65% accuracy. 


I recently realised that while the other models I tested a while back performed slightly worse than a RF model, a blended(/stacked?) approach might perform better than the RF on its own. 


My question: I suspect that certain models perform better in certain situations. E.g. if one feature (feature_1) has 3 discrete options (A, B, C), while the RF may perform best overall, a different model type might perform better on classifications specific to category B than the RF model. 


The few articles I've read on creating ensemble models, use a meta model with each base models probability predictions as the input features of the train dataset, but none of the base models' train dataset features. Would it be possible/advisable to include some of these original features in the meta model creation, e.g. feature_1 where I know that some models perform better for certain categories within this feature than others?

 Is there any problems in doing this and subsequently using the probabilities output? Extrapolating further, would it be inadvisable to include all original features in the meta model alongside each base models' predictions? In general if I'm interested in the probabilities of the meta model classifier, should I calibrate the end meta model instead using an Isotonic regression? 


For context, while this is a classification problem I'm interested in the computed probability as the primary output; I calibrate my RF model at the end using an Isotonic regression to hopefully improve the output probabilities. I have around 60k rows of data with around 50 base features, with another 50 ish created by me. I'd also be careful to train the meta model on a separate validation dataset.

"My husband is at TAMU but thinking of transferring to UTSA. In your experience, would this harm his career long term?",14weub6,meh12398,1689044309.0,,False,True,Education,2,False,2,"My husband asked me to make this post because he wants advice/perspectives from this community but isn’t on Reddit.

He is going into his sophomore year at Texas A&M University for engineering. He wants to study data engineering but was assigned Industrial Engineering by TAMU. They told him he could apply to transfer his major to Data Engineering after this semester, but he may not get into the program then either. In the meantime, his Industrial Engineering classes are not relevant to the Data Engineering coursework, so he would essentially be setting himself back a semester.

In addition to this, we have a 2yo and are expecting our second in September (they’re due the first week of classes at TAMU). We’ve been looking for housing but have been told that for our budget (2BR under $1100/month), we should not expect to find anything that doesn’t have cockroaches. Most places we’ve looked at also have rats, mold, and other health hazards we don’t want to expose our kiddos to.

Finally, my husband is a first-gen college student and going back later in life. He started college straight out of high school, but without the support he needed and going to a school out of state, he ended up dropping out. He’s now returning at 32 because the career path he wants to pursue (AI development) requires a degree. Financially, TAMU is going to put us in a lot of debt.

All this to say, everyone keeps telling him “You got into a great school for engineering, you should accept what they give you and move on,” but he’s worried that the industrial engineering degree won’t address the concepts he wants to learn for the career he wants to pursue, and he doesn’t want to go through an extra semester and incurring more debt without the guarantee that he’d be able to transfer majors.

He’s considering withdrawing from this semester’s classes at TAMU and transferring to the University of Texas in San Antonio in the Spring to major in CompSci with a focus on data science and a minor in statistics.

This option is much more affordable in terms of living expenses (it seems like housing isn’t as insane in San Antonio as College Station?) and also he would qualify for a lot more scholarships and grants at UTSA than he currently does at TAMU. We could also stay with my dad during the fall semester to save money instead of spending a few thousand on housing. Also, we have family in the San Antonio area, while in College Station we have no connections or sense of community.

His concern is he has heard TAMU has a great alumni network that guarantees a job coming out of school, and he’s not sure if UTSA has a similar network or as many career opportunities for their grads (this is not a slight to UTSA, more so that’s just a huge bragging point of TAMU and he doesn’t know how UTSA compares.)

We both would greatly appreciate your perspectives on whether the transfer seems worth it or if you think he would be better off long-term staying at TAMU for career opportunities coming out of college. Essentially, does the school make a big enough difference to justify going into debt and living in cockroach-infested apartments with babies for a few years because it would make him more money long-term?",False,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14weub6/my_husband_is_at_tamu_but_thinking_of/,datascience

Data NEWB with new Think Tank position: Need Suggestions/Advice,14w5nx7,Local_Order6899,1689021665.0,,False,True,Career,0,False,2,"tl;dr I have no formal background in datascience, but want to transition. I somehow got a job that might help me get my foot in the door but need help determining the best way to use this job as a springboard.

&#x200B;

**Background:**  
I am a philosophy PhD candidate. I lack a formal background in data science (done some ""certification"" courses like Elite Data Science, and some others; I know Python, some basics of SQL, and have decent knowledge of stats/probability, etc). My dissertation is in applied epistemology and one chapter deals with some aspects of Bayesian reasoning, but is otherwise unrelated.   


**Current Situation:**

I was recently hired by a public policy think tank as a researcher and as a mentor/ advisor to undergraduate research interns.  Our research focuses on economics/econometrics, urban planning, use of state finances/resources and general public policy. The think tank regularly publishes both academic work, data-informed policy proposals, and popular, public-facing articles. Currently we are focused on housing affordability in the United States. I will likely be here for a year or so.

I am hopeful that this position could be a stepping stone to a data related career. I need help determining the best way to leverage my time at the think tank toward achieving that goal. We work with large amounts of data, and do everything from Tableau visualizations to academic papers using Regression analysis. I will get author credit on several of these. There is also a possibility that I could get a funded MA in applied economics or applied statistics. I just don't know if I (or my wife) could handle starting grad school again.  


**Questions:**

How can I pivot my career toward data analytics or engineering? Should I prioritize academic publications, data management improvement (currently most data here is just thrown randomly into Google Drive folders), pursuing another grad degree, enhancing ""leadership"" skills with interns, or learning new tools like SAS (many use SAS here)? I'm open to all roles in data science, engineering, and analytics. Any and all advice is much appreciated.

[Q]",14vjwlj,AdFew4357,1688964110.0,,1688964562.0,True,Discussion,39,False,38,"Right now I’m working on a multivariate time series classification problem for a lab I’m working at. The training set is a multivariate time series with data collected over minutely level. Each time series is a type of positional tracking measurement. The goal is to classify each of the time series and see if they can discriminate between 3 different types of outcomes of interest. The labels are 0,1,2.

I’m doing this in PyTorch, and I read roughly 8-9 papers. They all seem to point to convolutional neural networks as a starting point. After building the model and setting up the training loops, this whole process feels like maybe 1% model building and 99% debugging, tuning, architecture changing, and tensor shape checking.

My day to day has just been stepping through my architecture with a debugger to fix bugs I’m getting during training, such as tensor mismatches, floating point error, and tuning of hyper parameters to mitigate the low test errors. 

Don’t even get me started on the runtime. I tweak one or two parameters, wait like 10 minutes, then check the results. Rinse and repeat. Now I’ve realized that my data representation is probably not correct and have to redo everything. Half the time is spent getting the data to be appropriately be shaped correctly so the network is doing stuff correctly. 

I thought I’d want a career in building deep learning models in the industry, but honestly, idk at this point after this project. It feels less of model building and more of model debugging. Half the stuff I’m doing feels arbitrary. Tweak a kernel size to this, make the number filters to that. See what happens and pray the accuracy is higher.

I actually felt more aware of what I was doing with data when I was previously doing work on Bayesian hierarchical models in Stan. Made so much sense. You write out the model, specify the prior and likelihoods, make any transformations if you need be, and then draw samples from posterior. Making distributional assumptions just made me feel like I knew what I was doing. 

With this deep learning project, it feels like 60% I know what’s going on because of the papers, 30% I can do because of domain knowledge of the dataset, and 10% I have no clue what’s going on and how parameters are affecting the model. I just tweaked the number of filters from 10, 12, and voila! A boost in accuracy by 10%. But no explanation for why.

When we look at the survey responses where the participant did answer the question (i.e did not leave it blank) we found that there is a pretty significant relationship between the variable we are trying to fill and the demographic variables, date-time variable, and other sentiment question responses.

So the current plan is to train a model (XGBoost/LightGBM/Logistic Regression/etc.) on the completed survey responses and then using the trained model to get the probability a particular survey participant falls within a certain class. Every week I get a new dump of survey responses into the database which needs to be classified.

Had two main questions here:

1.) How to take into consideration the variable of time into this exercise? What is the best way to encode this variable, and since the datetime someone responded to a survey has a fairly significant relationship to the target variable here, but we're not necessarily concerned with predicting into the future, are there still problems here with respect to data leakage that needs to be taken into account?

2.) When using tree-based models, what is the best way to interpret the probability score? I was having a bit of a hard time understanding of calibrating these probability score using platt scaling or other methodologies.",False,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14w1tap/dealing_with_classification_problems_w_a_time/,datascience

To PhD or not,14utmdj,datedscientist,1688893059.0,,False,True,Career,83,False,81,"Hi everyone. I think similar questions come up somewhat frequently here but I always find them somewhat generic.

I wanted to have the sub’s opinion on whether or not a PhD is worth pursuing in my situation, given that:

* I’m a mid level data scientist in Europe working my way towards being promoted to senior in the next year or two. I work at a big tech company - not FAANG but still a well-known brand
* My goal is to continue progressing in mt career and eventually getting a job at a top tier company in terms of compensation 
* I like what I do but perhaps I would also like to transition into a research scientist position (and that’s the biggest reason for considering a PhD)
* I think I could handle doing the PhD (I was considering something related to causal inference and public policy) while continuing my regular work. And I think I could definitely do some interesting research, but my college is not a very reputable one 
* I am genuinely interested in that research topic but I think I would only put myself through that if it provides significant benefit for my career

I’m a Data Analyst/Scientist with around 1.5y of experience, public sector in the UK. My background (undergrad and then PhD) was in Physics, so quite strong mathematically and some programming experience. For my PhD I analysed spacecraft data (mainly numerical), which gave me good experience coding in Python, processing/wrangling data, and applying statistical techniques and concepts; for example, Superposed Epoch Analysis, which is when you essentially average together a bunch of time series to try and detect periodicities.

However, because of my background, I wouldn’t say I’ve ever had any *formal* statistical or data scientist training. Whilst I’m perfectly competent at my job (coding in R/SQL), and regularly perform analyses like chi-squared and the occasional modelling, I have an inherent fear that there’s a flaw in my coding or that I’m not correctly interpreting a result.

I do try to quality assure my work by doing things like spot checking, but the problem is that even if a use something as a one-off, I’ve then forgotten all about it by the next time I come to use it.

Mid-level data scientist needs career progression advice.,14uw0s2,xy_is_ham,1688901334.0,,False,True,Career,4,False,11,"I have been a data scientist in title for slightly over 3 years in a mid-sized tech company. Due to the nature of the company, I ended up doing a lot more than what is traditionally expected of a DS role, and this includes a lot of engineering tasks which I really enjoyed. However, this makes me feel very insecure about being a jack of all trades instead of a master in modeling. 

To start off with a little background, I have a B.Sc in Mathematics and minor in Statistical modelling, I have a pretty decent understanding of theoretical foundations of classic ML as well as neural networks. I have a year worth of experience as an analyst that specializes in SQL and Python before my current DS job. 

When I started wit my current job, they have a very mature engineering team, but not at all on the data side. It was a really strange place because here were A LOT of data but unused and uncleaned. Somehow for so long, apart from the BI, they never thought of doing any sort of data science stuff. Anyway, I started out as any business-oriented DS role: fumbling around the database to look for good quality data to construct a training set, and talking to business owners and domain experts. After the model is being developed, I was tasked to deploy it to production. It's not exactly what I signed up for, but back then I thought it was fun, and there wasn't anymore potential use of ML in the business except for improving the one model we can afford to build. Due to that, I had to learn about building microservices, AWS, serverless, CI/CD and other DevOps practices. 

Eventually, the business expanded (like A LOT thanks to Covid) and they hired another DS whose only focus was model development and I ended up building and managing ML infrastructure. Since then, I was thrown with mainly Data Engineering tasks such as building a data lake (not even for the DS team) and feature store using Spark, Kafka and Airflow. Honestly I like these a lot more than modeling, but I feel like I'm massively missing out as someone in ML because I almost never touching model unless it's to convert Jupyter code to training script.

Currently, I am working on building a distributed training pipeline with Kubernetes, whereas my teammate is doing all the actual data science work. I feel like even though I have a decent theoretical understanding of modern tech such as transformers, I am really missing out on the hands on experiences with finetuning and training LLMs. And due to having to spend so much time learning about the engineering side of things, it becomes so much harder to keep up with new papers and new modeling techniques. 

So I guess my questions is, will I be able to stay relevant to the field if I spread myself out and develop more data engineering and MLOps skills? Or should I focus on the modeling aspect and be specialized in DS?",False,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14uw0s2/midlevel_data_scientist_needs_career_progression/,datascience
